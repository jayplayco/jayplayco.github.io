<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.</p>
<p>HUNT tokens are now available on the Daybit exchange for about 2 month and it seems that the current price is stabilizing between 0.0075 and 0.01USD with a slow increasing in price.</p>
<center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/jjuePCGn-image.png)</center>

<p>Based on the fact that the token is now out in the wild, it seems there is also an interest from investors and the community to have a better overview about some facts of the token.</p>

Overview of numbers for HUNT tokens.</h2><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/zfp9ILM3-image.png)</center>
It was planned to use 50% of Hunt tokens for the ecosystem and community building. The overview is as below.

<p>Total volume is 500Million Hunt tokens.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ecosystem and community building    50% - 250 Million Hunt tokens.</li>
<li>Reserve for future business development    20% - 100 Million Hunt tokens.</li>
<li>Team members (2 year vesting)    10% - 50 Million Hunt tokens</li>
<li>Token sales via IEO (Initial Exchange Offering)    10% - 50 Million Hunt tokens</li>
<li>2nd round funding    10% - 50 Million Hunt tokens</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let’s get into the details of how much tokens are now in the wild.</p>

<p>We have as of today (14th June 2019) in total 82,013,809 Hunt tokens distributed, which is 32.81% of the original planned Qty. The distribution speed has been dramatically slowed down after the listing of Hunt tokens, as the distribution system has been changed from a fixed pool of tokens to a market related ROI model. As an example with a 10K SP fully upvoting at Steemhunt 10 times, you were able to get an average over 1000 Hunt tokens in the beginning of the year as you would get it distributed based on the voting % of a fixed pool of <a href="https://steempeak.com/@jayplayco/steemhunt-overview-of-hunt-tokens-airdrop">40K Hunt tokens per day.</a> </p>
<p>In the moment upvotes at Steemhunt are coupled with an ROI per annum. A 4$STU upvote would get a result of about 46 HUNT tokens as reward which would be about 0.43USD. It is about 10% additionally you are able to get on top of your 25% curation reward. If we assume that there is no change in any price (Steem, Hunt, SBD, USD) and we would upvote 4$ STU per day at Steemhunt, we would have a SP+SBD curation reward of 365USD(Curation) + 156USD(Hunt Tokens) = 521USD. If you are anyhow curating on Steem, direct curation on Steemhunt would definitely increase your reward on a daily base.</p>
<p>But getting back to the total 82Million Hunt tokens distributed to the community. Especially from investors that have invested into the IEO of Hunt tokens, this community build Hunt tokens could be a thread to the price of the hunt token, as if all the Qty would be getting into the market, the price would collapse immediately. </p>
<p>Based on the information that the team has made accessible on different communication channels I would like to review these numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li>82Million Hunt tokens distributed for community building.</li>
<li>about 50Million Hunt tokens are unlocked (from the 13weeks lock directly after the listing of Hunt tokens)</li>
<li>about 8.4 Million (16.8% of the unlocked Qty) are moved to an external Wallet and 4.4 Million of them moved to an exchange or other external wallet. (A registered ETH wallet hooked to Steemhunt is still counted as staked Hunt)</li>
<li>This means that only 5.3% of the total distributed Hunt token Qty. is in the moment available for trading on the market.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that the support of the community is strong and the major Qty. of Hunt tokens are still staked on most of the wallets of Steemhunt users.</p>
<p>There are still about 167 Million tokens left that can be used to build the community, but the team already informed that when the swap to SMT is going to happen and POB and a proper inflation pool is working, that the left over Hunt tokens are going to be burned from the community building pool.</p>

<p>These Qty. are mainly for further business development opportunities and we will see official announcements when this kind of Qty. are going to be used. </p>
<h3 id="c-Team-member-2years-vesting"><a href="#c-Team-member-2years-vesting" class="headerlink" title="c. Team member (2years vesting)"></a>c. Team member (2years vesting)</h3><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/8QF0P5LV-image.png)</center>

<p>The vesting for team members started at the 15th of April 2019 and it is not yet decided how the payment schedule will look like, so there are in the moment no tokens distributed from this vesting at all.</p>
<h3 id="d-Token-sales-via-IEO-Initial-Exchange-Offering-50-Million-Hunt-tokens"><a href="#d-Token-sales-via-IEO-Initial-Exchange-Offering-50-Million-Hunt-tokens" class="headerlink" title="d.

There have been IEO's on three different exchanges, including Daybit, where the Hunt tokens have been listed. Except the second IEO on Probit, all other offerings had been sold out.

<p>Including the bonus Qty. that distributed, about 34 Million Hunt tokens have been sold during the IEO. (30 Million in sales and about 4 Million for bonus) Bonus Hunt tokens from the IEO had different lockup timings from 30-90 days.</p>
<p>Based on this information we can come to a conclusion that even if all the bonus Qty had been released, that we have in the moment about 35-43 Million Hunt tokens in circulation.</p>
<p>I personally think that the liquidity will increase with the launching of further exchanges and the start of Reviewhunt.</p>
<h3 id="e-2nd-round-funding-50-Million-Hunt-tokens"><a href="#e-2nd-round-funding-50-Million-Hunt-tokens" class="headerlink" title="e. 2nd round funding - 50 Million Hunt tokens"></a>e. 2nd round funding - 50 Million Hunt tokens</h3><p>The team is in the moment concentrating on bringing Reviewhunt into the market and after that Ideahunt to be able to finalize the Hunt token economy.</p>

<p>The team is in the moment gathered together in Korea and in Crunch mode to increase the speed  of development of Reviewhunt. Their main focus is to bring the product as fast as possible into the market and get influencers and makers on board. An important part for Reviewhunt is that Makers will be able to use FIAT for their marketing activities on Reviewhunt and that these marketing activies can lead to direct need on the Hunt token economy. As this kind of process has never been done before the team is working hard to realize this important step. The launch of Reviewhunt is planned for July 2019.</p>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, the negotiations with exchanges are still ongoing. The listing audit for Hunt tokens are partly finished for some of the exchanges, but there are still strategic priorities and internal issues within the exchanges to clear to get a final listing day. The team is going to decide and move forward based on the biggest synergy effect for Reviewhunt. The target is still to get a final decision from the exchanges within June, which would result in a listing after the decision made. </p>
