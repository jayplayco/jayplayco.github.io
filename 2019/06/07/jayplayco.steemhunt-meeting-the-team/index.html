<p>Hi, @jayplayco here,</p>
<p>Just met the team behind @steemhunt in their office and got a peak preview of some of the screenshots regarding Reviewhunt.</p>
<h3 id="Repository"><a href="#Repository" class="headerlink" title="Repository"></a>Repository</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web">https://github.com/Steemhunt/web</a></p>
<p>The video is showing a short part of the effects included and the platform looks as Steemhunt sleak, clean and smooth. The mobile environment is also optimized and constantly checked on different mobile devices.</p>
<p>Also met @ggomaeng the first time and he is a young, motivated energetic developer who is already in the middle of creating the frontend for Reviewhunt.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUTb35xTsSZDykqs6LiZWxLSLQHWYxksaHGDqPmHjGvfo/IMG_0233.JPG" alt="IMG_0233.JPG"></p>
<p>By the way, the keyboard @ggomaeng using was really cool, as he was typing on a small white keyboard without any printing on it. Need to get the information from here he got that. :)</p>

<p>@tabris and @project7 were also busy to prepare the launch of Reviewhung and constantly finetuning the onboarding part for Makers and Influencers. </p>
<p>It is still interesting that this team is able to meet each other offline only every few month (this time almost after 10 month) but still working effectively across continents. It means that the trust between the team members is mutual and very strong.</p>
<p>I was not able to get out a fixed dated for the launch of Reviewhunt, but after seeing a the progress it is sure that the team is on a good way to keep their promise and launch it.</p>
<p>A short interview with the developers, </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br>Hi, how is the progress going on with Reviewhunt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@tabris: After @ggomaeng joining the team, the speed of development is increasing day by day. @ggomaeng is so fast, that I need to speed up to keep up with him on the backend. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br>Wasn’t it difficult to join the team and get into the material?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@ggomaeng: It is actually what I have already done before, so that part was easy. In the moment I can really enjoy working on Reviewhunt, because the design templates from @project7 are in perfect manner, which is increasing my work speed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br>How does the launch plan for Reviewhunt look like?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@tabris: We are working full speed on the development and we are confident to keep the promised time plan, which had been communicated for July 2019.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was exiting to see the pre launch status behind the doors and to get the permission to share this information to everybody. Really looking forward for the launch in July.</p>
<p>Let’s the hunt begin~!!</p>
