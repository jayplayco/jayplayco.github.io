Hi, @jayplayco here.

<p>This time I would like to share some numbers about Steemhunt. All these numbers are gathered either from different openly accessible sources or have been published by Steemhunt.</p>
<h2 id="0-Repository"><a href="#0-Repository" class="headerlink" title="0. Repository"></a>0. Repository</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web">https://github.com/Steemhunt/web</a></p>
<h2 id="1-Dapps-Ranking"><a href="#1-Dapps-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="1. Dapps Ranking"></a>1. Dapps Ranking</h2><p><img src="https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/FQFPPPwM-image.png" alt="image.png"><br><a href="https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings">Source: stateofthedapss</a></p>
<p>Steemhunt is currently at rank nine(9) at <a href="https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings">State of the Dapps.</a> The rankings at State of the Dapps are based on different factors and the ranking is among the platforms of Steem, EOS and Ethereum (Also GoChain and POA is included as a platform but for the top rankings not really relevant.)</p>
<p>At State of the Dapps TRON is missing as a platform, which could change the rankings. An interesting part for State of the Dapps is, that the rank is based on multiple factors and that all kind of gambling Dapps are placed lower than rank 29.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rank is based on multiple factors including active users (unique source addresses in transactions to ÐApp contracts), transaction volume, developer activity, profile freshness and strength, CTRs, and user recommendations. The number next to the rank is the change over 24h.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyhow it is great to see that Steem Dapps are taking over the ranking with more than half of the top ten. This kind of activities are great and we can see already Steem Dapps spreading on different platforms, as @therealwolf has mentioned <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@therealwolf/steem-has-been-added-to-dapponline-io">here</a> that additionally due to the effort from @MTimeTraveller on beside of @steemhunt, Steem has been added as a platform on Dapponline.io.<br><a href="https://twitter.com/DappOnline/status/1083344249137987584">https://twitter.com/DappOnline/status/1083344249137987584</a></p>
<p>This kind of visibility is great, not only for Steemhunt but also for all related Steem Dapps, as it shows how great Steem based Dapps actually perform. Thanks again to @therealwolf for creating the API to make this kind of visibility possible.</p>
<h2 id="2-Traffic-Overview"><a href="#2-Traffic-Overview" class="headerlink" title="2. Traffic Overview"></a>2. Traffic Overview</h2><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/GbfwcQIL-image.png)
[Source: Stateofthedapps](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/steemhunt)</center>

<p>We can track that the general traffic for interfaces like steemit.com is decreasing but Steemhunt still keeps a stable userbase.</p>

[Source: Similarweb](https://www.similarweb.com/website/steemhunt.com#overview)</center>

<p>Based on the data from Similarweb (which is definitely not accurate but good enough to get an idea) we have a total visit of 153K visitors. An important part would be to see that the average visit duration is longer than 6 minutes. To understand the meaning for this number, as comparison producthunt.com shows an average visit duration of under 2:30 minutes.</p>
<p>It is important that your users stay long enough on your website, as this is also considered as engagement. So based on this data we could estimate that producthunt.com as an example does have much more traffic on their site, but that the users on Steemhunt are in the moment much more engaged with the service.</p>
<h2 id="3-Marketcap"><a href="#3-Marketcap" class="headerlink" title="3. Marketcap"></a>3. Marketcap</h2><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/8tSNl11Y-image.png)</center>

<p>We have now in total about 74 million tokens distributed and locked in wallets. Based on the Boost Hunt function the current HUNT token value is 1 STU=19.74 HUNT and based on a <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@steemhunt/massive-inflow-of-ces-products-in-steemhunt-hunt-token-price-term-11-influencers-or-sponsor-report-39">survey for IEO interested users</a>, they would be willing to pay 0.048USD per Hunt at an IEO. </p>
<p>Let’s estimate it conservatively on a value of 0.04USD per HUNT token and we count only the distributed ones, it come to a market cap of 2.9 million USD, which would place it at the moment at rank #478 at coinmarketcap.com. If we consider the whole planned 500 million tokens it is a market cap of 20 million USD and that would rank Steemhunt on rank 140 on CoinMarketCap.</p>
<h2 id="4-Hunters-Activity"><a href="#4-Hunters-Activity" class="headerlink" title="4. Hunters Activity"></a>4. Hunters Activity</h2><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/Gg7nDgui-image.png)</center>

<p>At <a href="https://token.steemhunt.com/">https://token.steemhunt.com/</a> we can get an overview of the all-time activities at Steemhunt. There have been more than 42K products been hunted and verified for ranking in the last 335 days. This is an average of at least 125 hunted products per day and we have to consider that not verified products are excluded.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Building a service and a community takes it time and effort. But if we see at the steps Steemhunt has been done, the project is even in this bearish market in a good way. The efforts to increase the visibility outside of Steem have just started and we look into a bright and great future for Steemhunt and the Steem Blockchain.</p>
