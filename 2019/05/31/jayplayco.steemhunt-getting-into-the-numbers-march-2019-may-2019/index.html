<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.</p>
<p>Today I would like to get into some details for the last three month and dig into some numbers for <a href="https://steemhunt.com?ref=jayplayco">Steemhunt.</a></p>
<h2> 0. Repository </h2>
https://github.com/Steemhunt/web

<h2>1. Where the numbers are coming from</h2>
The @steemhunt account is automatically posting the daily Top 10 and is including the information of how many products have been hunted and how much SBD had been created that day. I have manually crawled the product hunt and SBD information from each post for the last three month.

<p>Additionally, I used the historical data from coinmarketcap for the Steem price and the historical data from @coingecko for HUNT tokens based on the open price.</p>
<h2>2. Analyzing the numbers</h2>
We have now different kind of data available and I partly pivoted them or used them directly to see how Steemhunt is developing based on this numbers. 

<h3 id="a-Hunted-products-vs-SBD"><a href="#a-Hunted-products-vs-SBD" class="headerlink" title="a. Hunted products vs. SBD"></a>a. Hunted products vs. SBD</h3><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/ERxyUydp-image.png)
Steemhunt hunted products vs. SBD</center>

<p>Here is a direct comparison between how many products have been hunted in the last three month and how much SBD had been created each day. We have an average of 155 products per day hunted and can see that these numbers are not changing that much. The created SBD reward per day shows a steady decline for the last 90 days.</p>
<h3 id="b-Daily-SBD-output-level"><a href="#b-Daily-SBD-output-level" class="headerlink" title="b. Daily SBD output level"></a>b. Daily SBD output level</h3><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/HweUyRS3-image.png)
Daily SBD output</center>
The generated SBD shows a different kind of development. We had an average of 374 SBD per day in March, 317 SBD in April and 260 SBD in May. This is a reduction of about 15-17% per month in daily SBD reward creation. As the reward created directly from the Steemhunt account should be on a similar level, it shows that the upvoting coming from community members is decreasing. The main reason behind these number changes can be estimated from the change how Steemhunt is rewarding upvotes within the community since the listing at Daybit. Before it was based on a pool and distributed based on the upvotes. After the listing it is based on the listing price and a specific % of ROI to give incentives to upvoters.

<h3 id="c-Product-Numbers-vs-Steem-Price"><a href="#c-Product-Numbers-vs-Steem-Price" class="headerlink" title="c. Product Numbers vs. Steem Price"></a>c. Product Numbers vs. Steem Price</h3><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/9TuVhUH7-image.png)
Product Numbers vs. Steem Price</center>
If we have a closer look into the numbers here, we can see a pattern that the numbers of hunted products is increasing or decreasing around the timeframe when the Steem price is changing. Due to the fact that all Steemhunt hunters are active members of the Steem community, they seem to have a motivation to hunt more products when the Steem price is better, as the rewards coming in STU$ should be also on a higher level. 

<h3 id="d-Average-Product-hunts-vs-SBD-based-on-Weekdays"><a href="#d-Average-Product-hunts-vs-SBD-based-on-Weekdays" class="headerlink" title="d. Average Product hunts vs. SBD based on Weekdays"></a>d. Average Product hunts vs. SBD based on Weekdays</h3><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/usKGMJMI-image.png)
Average Product hunts vs. SBD based on Weekdays</center>
We have the highest average of hunted products on Tuesdays and Fridays. The average highest reward creation in SBD are on Sunday. It looks like that product hunting hunters are most active in the week and curating hunters mostly on Sundays. The SBD reward creation has a difference of about 6.3% between the highest day of Sunday and the lowest day of Friday and Wednesday.

<p>As strategy for a product hunter Sundays and Mondays would be beneficial, as they show lower products hunted (less competition) and higher SBD rewards.</p>
<h3 id="e-Steem-vs-HUNT-price-development"><a href="#e-Steem-vs-HUNT-price-development" class="headerlink" title="e. Steem vs. HUNT price development"></a>e. Steem vs. HUNT price development</h3><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/z864STE2-image.png)
Steem vs. HUNT price development</center>
The HUNT token price is moving without any relevance to the Steem price. If we consider that HUNT token is a BTC paired listing on Daybit, it is even moving without any relevance to the BTC development. It looks like that there are in the moment getting more HUNT tokens out to the market than possible buyers are available, which would explain the price fall for the last month. On the other side, we can also see that the price of HUNT tokens are keeping on a level of 0.08-9 USD and not moving further down. 

<h2>3. Conclusion</h2>
Based on my latest information I got from the Steemhunt team, the development speed should increase even further, as it is planned to combine the development power locally into on place. At the moment the development resources are remotely working from different continents. Remote work is a great way to increase resources without having the limitation of localization, but on the other hand, as development is still done from humans, I believe that there is a positive impact when the communication between developers can happen in real time and also offline.

<p>Looking forward to the launch of Reviewhunt and how it is going to impact the Steemhunt community and what it would change for the HUNT token price. We have an exiting time before us.</p>
