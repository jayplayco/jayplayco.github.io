Hi, @jayplayco here.

<p>The next pillar of Steemhunt is coming closer and the pre-signup page for hunters and companies has opened now. Steemhunt has also revealed a few screenshots about Reviewhunt and I would like to go into details how the service would look like and how it would work as a hunter.</p>
<h2 id="0-Repository"><a href="#0-Repository" class="headerlink" title="0. Repository"></a>0. Repository</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web">https://github.com/Steemhunt/web</a></p>
<h2 id="1-The-main-screens"><a href="#1-The-main-screens" class="headerlink" title="1. The main screens"></a>1. The main screens</h2><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/h8jAJAtv-image.png)</center>
The screen above is showing a pre-shot of the page a maker would see. A point that has to be mentioned is, that Reviewhunt is a closed platform. It means that you will need to sign-up and confirmed to be able to participate as a hunter. The main reason is the characteristics of business marketing, who prefer to keep their marketing activities not directly visible, as it could also give too much information to competitors.

<p>What we can see on this screen is as followed</p>
<ul>
<li>Different Channels on a tab: Steem Dapps, Reddit, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, Medium, etc.</li>
<li>Hunter profiles with active channels an index called Hype index. As I know the Steemhunt team I guess it will be mainly having the follower numbers included but also different other data like the engagement of their posts, reach and success of former reviews from Reviewhunt, etc. </li>
<li>A short overview about the Hunter with a button to request a Review.</li>
<li>A  visual overview of recent reviews from the specific hunter.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first moment, I got the urgent need to have a category for hunters in which categories the hunters are reviewing, but as Reviewhunt is concentrating mainly on products that could be featured at Steemhunt, this kind of category would be obsolete. </p>
<p>From my personal side if I would be a maker I would need a place where I could filter the hunters based on different points. Mainly I would need the following filters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Country</li>
<li>Channel</li>
<li>Min-Max Hype Index</li>
</ul>
<p>Judging from the “request for review” button the screen could be used, from the user interface scenario, either before or after the start of a campaign. For hunters, it is going to be crucial to have an up to date portfolio and also the being active and successful on the channels the brands are looking for exposure.</p>

The screen above definitely shows a screen after the start of a campaign. The screen is mainly concentrating on showing data visually of your current campaign. We can see the following here.
* How much HUNT tokens are planned as a reward 
* On which channel content is created
* What the daily hype index looks like
* Information about which content gathered most of the attraction
* Download button to get the data on your local disk.

This screen is showing the profile page of a hunter. We can see that there are active review offers from makers and below we can see which kind of products are offered for review. Based on the tabs the hunter will be also able to see his former reviews written on different platforms.

Another interesting part is that there is also a community-based moderation system planned to review the entries from hunters. Steemhunt has run successfully a community-based moderator system for about a year with over 60K hunts moderated.

There are already companies signing up to use the power of over 20,000 blockchain-powered product influencers. And we can see based on the numbers of signed hunters that they can reach over millions of interested users on their channels.

<p>An interesting fact is, that we have a lot of Reddit Karmas, which are not easy to target from brands due to their specific niches and way of communication. </p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/l40hH1NR-image.png)</center>
Seeing a blockchain based startup really running as a traditional startup is great, as we need more of this kind to gain the trust of normal users and companies. It is also one of the slower ways but definitely an effective way to get the words out for the Steem Blockchain.
