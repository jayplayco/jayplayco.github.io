<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.</p>
<p>As Steemhunt is running on the Steem Blockchain, almost all of the data are available to look into and to see what had happened with the Steem Power they have over the last year.</p>
<p>I would like to summarize some key numbers and look into the meanings.</p>
<h2 id="1-Delegation"><a href="#1-Delegation" class="headerlink" title="1. Delegation"></a>1. Delegation</h2><h3 id="a-Outgoing-Delegation"><a href="#a-Outgoing-Delegation" class="headerlink" title="a. Outgoing Delegation"></a>a. Outgoing Delegation</h3><p>In total 395 accounts got a delegation of 15.088SP from Steemhunt, which results in total of 5959SP delegated. Steemhunt is providing an easy signup process, which is based on the RC from Steemhunt. As of the current HF20 Code, there is a bug that you have actually 0 RC after an account has been created and Steemhunt is supporting it for a month with a delegated SP to overcome this issue.<br>In the beginning there have been several attempts to abuse the signup process from Steemhunt, but with a well working blacklist and several safety mechanism, the abusing rate is now under control. Steemhunt has now accumulated 18,369 accounts and counting.<br>As Steemhunt is delegating only for a month, this means that Steemhunt has brought in 395 new accounts that have gone through a mobilephone number check before making their Steem account on Steemhunt.</p>

<h3 id="b-Incoming-Delegation"><a href="#b-Incoming-Delegation" class="headerlink" title="b. Incoming Delegation"></a>b. Incoming Delegation</h3><p>There are in total 246 accounts delegating to Steemhunt with a total power of 1,4 Million SP. The biggest part is from Steemit Inc. (73%) and the second biggest delegator is freedom with 11% of the whole delegation.</p>

<h2 id="2-Rewards-All-Time"><a href="#2-Rewards-All-Time" class="headerlink" title="2. Rewards All Time"></a>2. Rewards All Time</h2><p>If you look at <a href="https://steemworld.org/@steemhunt">https://steemworld.org/@steemhunt</a> you can find several datas about an account thanks to the great work of @steemchiller. </p>
<h3 id="a-Author-SP-rewards"><a href="#a-Author-SP-rewards" class="headerlink" title="a. Author SP rewards"></a>a. Author SP rewards</h3><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/6K6pbAzz-image.png)</center>
The account @steemhunt is making a daily report about the top 10 hunts, how much SBD has been created and how many products have been hunted.

Additionally, once a week there is a sponsor report about the distributed HUNT tokens for delegators and also additional information and updates about Steemhunt. It is in total about 8 postings per week and the postings get an average of 2.75STU $ per posting. It is about 25-27 Steem per week and the all time data shows, that they have gathered in total 13,858 Steem. With 603 posts, this is an average of 22.9 Steem. The difference of an average is, because when Steemhunt is announcing bigger updates, the team uses bots (like other projects) to gain the needed attraction of the community. 

<h3 id="b-Curation-SP-rewards"><a href="#b-Curation-SP-rewards" class="headerlink" title="b. Curation SP rewards"></a>b. Curation SP rewards</h3><p>25% of the 1.4 Million SP is coming back as curation reward. The @steemhunt account is running as a upvoting bot for the Steemhunt service and is upvoting most of the VP for their Steemhunt hunters on the daily ranking board. The distribution system is now after a year very mature and optimized. </p>
<p>The first time when the @steemhunt bot needed to be stopped was when HF20 was live and the RC was not even for Steemhunt enough to run the bot. After the fast patch from Steemit Inc, Steemhunt was able to run the bot again. </p>
<p>Steemhunt has now upvoted 252K times and a curation SP of 76,392. It means for each upvote there had been an average of 0.30 SP in curation reward over the time. </p>
<h3 id="c-Witness-rewards"><a href="#c-Witness-rewards" class="headerlink" title="c. Witness rewards"></a>c. Witness rewards</h3><p>@steemhunt is also running a witness server and supporting the steem community with different kind of services like a blacklist API. They are no on rank 32 with 43,736M MV and were able to create about 1,160SP in the last 30 days.</p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>As we can see the account is running smooth and the team behind Steemhunt is taking care that no resources are spend without a reason or that no resources are just sitting around. It is now July and I am looking forward to hear about the launch of Reviewhunt. It seems that the negotiations with makers who want to use Reviewhunt is moving forward and we are now on day counting of launching Reviewhunt.</p>
