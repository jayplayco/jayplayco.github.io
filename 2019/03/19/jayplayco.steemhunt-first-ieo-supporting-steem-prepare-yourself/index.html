<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.</p>
<p>The first IEO from Steemhunt at IDCM was very successful and reached 100% of the target within the first 3 minutes. As IDCM was allowing to overachieve the target, the final result was almost 150% and more than 5 Million HUNT tokens sold. As many Steemians have waited for an IEO where you can buy yourself in with Steem, this event is coming near and I would like to prepare all interested Steemians for this.</p>
<h2 id="0-Repository"><a href="#0-Repository" class="headerlink" title="0. Repository."></a>0. Repository.</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web">https://github.com/Steemhunt/web</a></p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-an-IEO"><a href="#1-What-is-an-IEO" class="headerlink" title="1. What is an IEO?"></a>1. What is an IEO?</h2><p>IEO means “Initial Exchange Offering”. When an ICO is planned and executed from the project itself, an IEO is done from an exchange, which means that at least one party and layer more was involved to check if a project is legit and workable for an IEO or not. For Steemhunt the first IEO at IDCM was very successful and the second IEO with Probit is also really promising, as it is going to be the first ever IEO where you can buy the Tokens with Steem. I have talked with the Steemhunt team and it seems that they had long talks with Probit and managed to convince them to establish Steem also as trading pair for the IEO at Probit. Thanks to the @probit team!</p>

<h2 id="3-Prepare-yourself-for-the-IEO"><a href="#3-Prepare-yourself-for-the-IEO" class="headerlink" title="3. Prepare yourself for the IEO"></a>3. Prepare yourself for the IEO</h2><p>I got some complaints from potential investors who didn’t know that they need to finish the KYC at the exchange to be able to participate at the IEO. Unfortunately, it takes normally up to 24 hours to finish the whole process for KYC, so it is recommended to start with the signup earlier and finish the KYC process before the IEO starts. The main reason for that is, that the available Qty. at Probit is not that big with 7,5 Million HUNTs and you need to be ready and fast if you want to be one of the first 30 persons who benefit additionally from the special sales event. </p>
<h3 id="a-Preparation"><a href="#a-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="a. Preparation"></a>a. Preparation</h3><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/OVMFeBjr-image.png)</center>
* Sign Up at Probit : [www.probit.com](https://www.probit.com/r/58160411) with your email. There is a verification of your email requested. (Please be aware that there is a referral link included. Please connect directly to https://www.probit.com to avoid the referral)
* Verify your ID: 
<center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/ZqKu1jbY-image.png)</center>
1) You are requested to input your full name, address, 
2) You will be asked to identify yourself with your Passport, Identity Card or Driver's license (may vary based on your country)
3) The verification service is handled by [Netverify.com](https://portal.netverify.com/login) by Jumio
4) In my case, the service asked also for a photo from myself to identify that I am the holder of the identification.
5) After that, you will get back to probit.com and see a message that the verification can take up to 7 days.
6) I have asked Probit through Steemhunt and for the Korean KYC (which is even more strict with 4 steps) Probits answer was that it will normally take about a day to finish the KYC process.

<h2 id="4-IEO-Event-at-Probit"><a href="#4-IEO-Event-at-Probit" class="headerlink" title="4. IEO Event at Probit"></a>4. IEO Event at Probit</h2><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/Zu8ReSnX-image.png)</center>

<p>Like at the first IEO, also Probit prepared a Sales event and from my experience at the first IEO, the investors did their best in the first minutes to grab that bonus. There is a bonus for the top 5 investors buying most of HUNT tokens and a 5000 HUNT token bonus for the first 30 buyers buying for more than 300USD  (worth 100USD). </p>
<p>The top five people will get the following bonus.</p>
<ul>
<li>1st place (1 person) : 50,000 HUNT (worth $1,000)</li>
<li>2nd place (1 person) : 40,000 HUNT (worth $800)</li>
<li>3rd place (1 person) : 30,000 HUNT (worth $600)</li>
<li>4th place (1 person) : 20,000 HUNT (worth $400)</li>
<li>5th place (1 person) : 10,000 HUNT (worth $200)</li>
</ul>
<p>My personal strategy would be to manage to be as fast as possible (if you are anyhow interested in buying yourself into this IEO) to try to get into the first 30 investors. The international timeline for the start would be as followed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Los Angeles    21th March 08:00 PM</li>
<li>Mexico City    21th March 09:00 PM</li>
<li>New York        21th March 11:00 PM</li>
<li>São Paulo    21th March 12:00 PM</li>
<li>London        22th March  03:00 AM</li>
<li>Berlin, Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid, Roma    22th March 04:00 AM</li>
<li>Mumbai    22th March : 08:30 AM</li>
<li>Hong Kong    22th March : 11:00 AM</li>
<li>Tokyo    22th March : 12:00 AM</li>
<li>Sydney    22th March : 14:00 PM</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategically, the European continent is not in a good starting time, as it is in the middle of the night. But for the American continent and Asia, Australia it looks good.<br>Additionally, I would not wait too long, as the first IEO was not offering STEEM but achieved 100% within the first 3 minutes and overachieved up to 50%. Probit does not offer overachieving, so when the 7,5 Million HUNTs are gone, they are gone. I have already various information from different sources that the Korean Steem community is already preparing themselves for this IEO, as they were waiting for the possibility to buy in STEEM. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, not only STEEM but also EOS, BTC, ETH, and XRP are available. </p>
<p>The Probit own PROB coin is also available and offers the biggest bonus rate (additional 5%), but after looking in detail into the exchange be informed about the following fact. Probit offers only PROB/USDT on their exchange. They have also only USDT, BTC and ETH pairs. This means the only way to get PROBs is to transfer BTC or ETH to Probit, change it to USDT and then to PROB. This may payout when the transfer loss/win is manageable, as you will get a 5% Bonus. </p>
<h2 id="5-Earn-additional-HUNTs-with-referral"><a href="#5-Earn-additional-HUNTs-with-referral" class="headerlink" title="5. Earn additional HUNTs with referral"></a>5. Earn additional HUNTs with referral</h2><center>![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/eUf9YNIi-image.png)</center>

<p>I am sure that there are not that many users have signed up at Probit. Steemhunt x Probit is currently running a referral event where you get 1% of your friend’s purchase when they signup with your referral code. You can find your referral code under the menu “REFERRAL PROGRAM”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.probit.com/r/58160411"><img src="https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/jayplayco/NdbNPCRT-image.png"></p>
<p>The referral code would look like the following :<br>https://www.probit.com/r/58160411</p>
<p>So if you know somebody who is interested in joining the IEO, make sure that you forward your referral link. :)</p>
<h2 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h2><p>It is really great to see the team that I have supported for almost a year getting their success on the IEO market. The Steemhunt x Probit IEO is really a great opportunity to join the IEO program without any hassle, as it can be bought also with Steem. There is a good summary from Probit how they explain Steemhunt. (https://medium.com/probit-exchange/steemhunt-provides-a-launchpad-for-tech-based-innovation-248a3ddc38a8) If you find the time, you should also have a quick look at the presentation of how <a href="https://www.probit.com/en-us/ieo/hunt-round1/0">Steemhunt is explaining themselves on the Probit platform.</a><br>The most important part for me mentioned here is also a core about Steem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most ICO projects hire dozens of “just-for-fame-filling-purpose” advisors and have large team members before they create a product or entice a single user. … …<br>We have formed a lean team that focuses on the product, and we have created a community-driven operating system that is optimized for the decentralized environment.<br><a href="https://www.probit.com/en-us/ieo/hunt-round1/0">Source: Steemhunt presentation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to say that I am proud to be part of this movement. The community is the core of the product and the community is strong. Thanks for this great community.</p>
