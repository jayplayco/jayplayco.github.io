<p>Hi, @jayplayco here,<br>JJM is evolving from day to day and we are planning the next event to enhance the usage of JJM and also help the economy of Steem in general. For that reason, we came across the fact that Steemmonsters already have a really great platform and that we should encourage the community to develop Steemmonsters to a full e-sports section. After a short talk with @yababmatt and giving a few insights of what we are planning with JJM/Steemmonsters. We are glad that will have now the help from Steemmonsters to push this project forward. Yeah~!</p>
<p>With the existing Steemmonsters system and the Steem environment, we would like to start a pilot tournament event. It would be great if a lot of Steemians would join this event when we are starting it.</p>
<h1 id="1-What-is-the-event-about"><a href="#1-What-is-the-event-about" class="headerlink" title="1 What is the event about."></a>1 What is the event about.</h1><p>The event is going to be held as a normal Steemmonsters tournament, where the prize money for the Pilot league will be in total 10,000 JJM tokens (worth in the moment of writing about 800 Steem)</p>
<ul>
<li>First prize is 5,000 JJM </li>
<li>Second place is 2,500 JJM </li>
<li>The third and fourth places are 500 JJM per person</li>
<li>5th to 8th places are 125 JJM per person</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also an additional reward pool of total 1,000 JJM’s secured for those who support the winner.</p>
<h1 id="2-Why-are-we-announcing-an-event-and-not-just-start-with-it"><a href="#2-Why-are-we-announcing-an-event-and-not-just-start-with-it" class="headerlink" title="2 Why are we announcing an event and not just start with it?"></a>2 Why are we announcing an event and not just start with it?</h1><p>The purpose of making this announcement before we prepare for our league is that we need people (strategic evaluators) who can evaluate a strategy ahead of the game. If you want to apply for this part, please leave a comment.</p>
<p>They’re going to play two big roles in the game league (a role for Steemmonsters and a role on Steem)</p>
<p>The first role is to broadcast games at the level of explaining to beginners. Since beginners are the key here, we hope the strategic evaluators are able to stimulate their curiosity and interest. Of course, information on tactical strategies and tips should be central.</p>
<p>The second role is to analyze each player’s performance and strategy when game players are added before the game starts. This includes predictions about the winner.</p>
<p>The reward for the strategic evaluator is as following</p>
<ul>
<li>A certain percentage of posting from the account virus707</li>
<li>If the nomination for the winner was right, 50% of the 1000 JJM reward pool for supporters will be distributed to the evaluator. (If there are multiple evaluators right, the 500 JJM will be distributed evenly)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="3-Timeline"><a href="#3-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="3 Timeline"></a>3 Timeline</h1><p>We are planning to promote the tournament long enough before it is going to be held.<br>We’ll check the pilot tournament to see what needs to be fixed. And with the support from Steemmonsters, we will try to minimize the trial and errors before the official launch. </p>
<p>After the official launch, JJM’s prize money will continue to grow, and the incentive prize will activate the card market for existing players.<br>We think that will also stimulate new players to enter the Steemmonsters market. </p>
<h1 id="4-Our-goal"><a href="#4-Our-goal" class="headerlink" title="4 Our goal"></a>4 Our goal</h1><p>is to engage also users who are not actively playing Steemmonsters but will have fun to watch, discuss enjoy the tournaments and create that kind of league for Steemmonsters with JJM.</p>
<h1 id="5-Advantage-for-JJM"><a href="#5-Advantage-for-JJM" class="headerlink" title="5 Advantage for JJM"></a>5 Advantage for JJM</h1><p>General awareness for JJM itself and also stable liquidity for wider use. Additionally, we would be able to create additional revenue with posting/advertisement. </p>
<h1 id="6-Action-points"><a href="#6-Action-points" class="headerlink" title="6 Action points"></a>6 Action points</h1><ul>
<li>Please resteem this event posting and leave a comment! We will send a few JJM as thank you</li>
<li>If you have any idea for an event, please leave a comment.</li>
<li>Professional leagues are running on commercials. :) So please also leave a message if you want to advertise or know somebody who wants to advertise. </li>
