<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.</p>
<p>The first ever IEO for a Steem based project is starting in 3 days at IDCM KOREA. You can find the official announcement from IDCM at the following <a href="https://www.idcmkorea.io/news/announcement_details?keywords=03111911">link</a>.</p>
<h2 id="0-Repository"><a href="#0-Repository" class="headerlink" title="0. Repository"></a>0. Repository</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web">https://github.com/Steemhunt/web</a></p>
<h2 id="1-IDCM-Details"><a href="#1-IDCM-Details" class="headerlink" title="1. IDCM Details"></a>1. IDCM Details</h2><center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRyvFt3sQbzMcoNQ9JiwK9iYfPLkwXU5YvpTNSqgb8hHp/image.png)</center>
As @steemhunt has revealed, there are in total 4 IEO's planned at different exchanges and at least one exchange is going to list the HUNT token directly after the last IEO. We have now the information that IDCM and Probit are the first two exchanges and my personal guess is that Daybit is going to be one of the 4 IEO exchanges, but the last one is not revealed and there had been no breadcrumbs so far which exchange it could be.

<p>Now the details for IDCM are released and I would like to share the information here.</p>
<p>IDCM IEO Details: </p>
<ul>
<li>Start : KST 14th March 2019 12:00</li>
<li>Token Name: SteemHunt (HUNT)</li>
<li>Total Premium Coin Sale Supply: 3,750,000 HUNT</li>
<li>Premium Coin Sale Price: Prices in BTC, ETH, IT will be set on the day of the Sale.</li>
<li>Premium Coin Sale Links: <a href="http://www.idcmkorea.io/coinsale/home">www.idcmkorea.io/coinsale/home</a><br><a href="https://www.idcmkorea.io/news/announcement_details?keywords=03111911">Source: IDCM Korea</a></li>
</ul>
<p>IDCM will accept BTC, ETH and IT. </p>

In addition to the common marketing activities, @steemhunt also started to target crypto orientated customers in Korea. One of these marketing activities is to create a separate Chat room based on Kakao Talk, which is the main messenger used in South Korea. In collaboration with a big Crypto News and information site called [Cobak](https://cobak.co.kr/) they started an event to introduce Steemhunt to potential investors and users. Steemhunt is currently in the middle to create a  wave between crypto investors and successfully gathered more than 800 interested users in their chat room within the first 20minutes of the first event.

</center>

<p>It seems that the collaboration with Cobak is very powerful, as the requested event app registered more than 1300 users at the same time in this marketing event.</p>

<h2 id="3-What-can-we-expect"><a href="#3-What-can-we-expect" class="headerlink" title="3. What can we expect?"></a>3. What can we expect?</h2><p>Nobody can predict the market or the behavior of investors. But as we have already two exchanges for IEO’s announced and the next two around the corner, it looks quite good for this project. I was live participating at the “Cobac Event” and it was incredible to see how fast users joined not only the event but also the chat room. At the moment the chat room is at a level of about 830 users and there are more events planned to increase the attention (also with Cobac) for this chat room and Steemhunt. </p>
<p>These users may not be directly converted to Steem users, but looking into the “general” questions from normal crypto investors in the chat room you could see things like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is that Steem the same like “Steam” for games? (It is pronounced and written the same in Korean)<ul>
<li>This means that normal Crypto investors do not really know what Steem is if they have not already invested in it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I heart that there is something like “delegation”, but what is that?<ul>
<li>They are interested, as this kind of investing is totally new to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wow, Hunt token is for a top ranked Dapp.<ul>
<li>We have several top Dapps based on Steem and it looks like that it is indeed a solid argument to attract investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of Steemians may have recognized that the Steem price is rising again and we have to look close to the reasons. Based on the data from @coingecko, you can see that an estimated 60% of the trading volume in made in South Korea.  We had a similar % when the last rising happened with Steem.</p>

<p>Different kind of Crypto Communities in South Korea “could” be partly responsible for this short bull run as there are views that Steem is <a href="https://coinpan.com/free/129423734">currently undervalued</a>. </p>
<p>Altogether, marketing for Steem based projects will reflect positively on the Steem economy in total and I am looking forward for the next few days, when the IEO for Steemhunt goes live and the next IEO exchange canditates are going to be revealed.</p>
