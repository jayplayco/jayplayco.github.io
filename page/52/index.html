<p>안녕하세요 @jayplayco 입니다. 슬금 슬금 스팀이 샤르륵 빠져나가면서 카드가 한두장씩 채워지네요. 오늘은 스팀몬스터에서 카드 카테고리에 대해서 알아보겠습니다.</p>
<h2>0. 주소</h2>
https://steemmonsters.com/

<h2>1. 스팀몬스터 카드 카테고리 </h2>

<p>스팀몬스터의 카드는 여러종류의 카테고리가 있습니다. 어떤 종류의 카드가 있고 희귀성에 대한 의미를 확인해보겠습니다. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcvfVwkiBcNrbZR2U7ZMcnaPw28JseMD7AfhT4EqtXWzg/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>상단의 그림에서 보시다시피, 스팀몬스터에서 “My Collection”에 가면 카드의 종류를 한눈에 볼 수 있습니다.  각 아이콘을 누르시면 그에 해당하는 소유카드를 보실 수 있습니다. 왼쪽의 Show All 버튼을 클릭하시면 소유하지 않은 카드도 같이 보여지게 됩니다. 어떤 카드가 비는지를 보기 위한 좋은 방법입니다. 카드는 일반 카드와 골드카드가 있습니다만, 골드카드는 종류, 레벨, 희귀성이 일반카드와 똑같습니다만, 단지 골드카드의 출현율이 1.5%대라는 것이 함정입니다. 즉, 일반카드 보다 약 100배정도 나올 확률이 적은것입니다. 확률적으로는 부스터팩 (개당 2불)에 카드가 5장 들어있으니, 총 40불 (20팩)을 열어야지 골드카드가 한장 나올 확률입니다. ^^</p>
<h3>1) 종류</h3> 
**몬스터라**는 종류와 **소환사**라는 종류가 있습니다. 나중에 전투가 열리게 되었을때 몬스터는 싸움을 하고 소환사는 싸움을 직접 하지는 않지만, 소환사 레벨에 따라 부를 수 있는 최대 몬스터가 한정이 될 예정입니다. 즉, 소환사 레벨이 1이면 몬스터도 1까지만 소환할 수 있습니다. 레벨 3의 몬스터를 소환해도 능력치는 레벨 1밖에 못쓰는 것입니다. 그래서 소환사를 레벨업 해놓는 것이 중요합니다. 

<p>하기는 제가 가지고 있는 소환사 카드입니다. 아직 Selena Sky은 못 구했네요.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQHSq7dgMj1MDWm3UWnfXfFKb3aZ2z8TeQjX5pHye6SEj/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>2) 희귀성</h3> 
총 4가지의 단계가 있습니다. 일반, 희귀, 에픽, 전설.

<h4>a. 일반 / Common</h4>
하기 보시면 일반 등급에 해당하는 카드들을 보실 수 있습니다. 제가 가지고 있는 댁입니다만, 현재 일반 카드는 다 모았습니다. 부스터팩을 구매했을 때 일반카드들은 자주 나오기 때문에 중복되는 카드들도 많이 생기는데, 이럴때는 합쳐서 레벨을 올리시면 됩니다. 제가 가지고 있는 카드들 중에서도 일부 레벨이 5까지도 올라가는 카드가 있습니다. 
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNfZBvvG8xfqeGJEHzzk2VBydBrxp5Ug9TuYUCLVeBPps/image.png)

<h4>b. 희귀 / Rare</h4>
희귀카드의 경우는 총 15종이 있습니다. 제 댁을 보시면 희귀카드도 다 모았습니다. 일부 카드는 중복이 들어와서 레벨업 하고 레벨 2까지 올라갔습니다.
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWAGUyRZXvtCUyKp3LmiNwJ78q1yKrAZsfKForBoJwXJW/image.png)

<h4>c. 에픽 / epic</h4>
에픽 카드의 경우는 총 10종의 카드가 있습니다. 보시다시피 에픽은 아직 많이 비어있죠? 
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdjpftLkEGpdktGzppbtvPQ4f5RAjMR8TPgmbJv5PP2HC/image.png)

<h4>d. 전설 / legendary</h4>
전설 카드는 총 8종류가 있는데 정말 잘 안나옵니다. 제 댁을 보시면 아직 하나도 안나왔습니다. ^^;
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmV8BUzY5KLfvWFoQbTBsVwN4vcqSF1xrJkdphsWJZFk3q/image.png)

<h3>3) 성향</h3> 
성향은 총 6가지 성향이 있습니다. 불,물, 지구, 생명, 죽음과 용입니다. 색상별로 카드에 차이가 있습니다. 불은 카드가 빨간색이고, 물은 파란색, 지구는 녹색, 생명은 하얀색, 죽음은 검정색과 용은 보라색입니다. 보라색 용 빼고는 당연한 색상의 선택인듯 합니다. 용은 보라색이라. 아마도 유럽 중세기 왕족의 색상이 보라였던 것이 바탕이 되지 않았을까 짐작해봅니다. 

<p>이 성향은 추후 전투에서 소환사가 불러올 수 있는 몬스터의 종류와 전투 방식의 차이를 결정하게 될 것으로 보입니다.</p>
<h2>2. 내가 좋은 카드를 뽑았는가? </h2>

<p>내가 좋은 카드를 뽑았는지를 확인하기 위해서는 카드의 희귀성을 확인해야 합니다. 즉, 일반, 희귀, 에픽, 전설이냐에 따라서 좋은 (비싼) 카드인지가 결정이 됩니다. 하기 일반적인 부스터팩의 짧은 오픈 동영상을 보시면 마지막 카드가 RARE로 희귀카드입니다. 우선 열릴때 열리는 동영상이 일반 카드와는 다릅니다. 반짝반짝 합니다. (아.. 이게 중독성이….) </p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/qbj5qx5.gif">https://i.imgur.com/qbj5qx5.gif</a></p>
<p>결국 부스터팩 열면서 카드의 희귀성을 곧바로 확인 가능합니다. 희귀성의 순서는 일반&lt;희귀&lt;에픽&lt;전설&lt;&lt;&lt;골도 일반&lt;골드 희귀&lt;골드 에픽&lt;골드전설 입니다. </p>
<p>카드의 가격도 저 희귀성에 따라서 매겨지고 있으며 현재 가장 희귀한 카드는 소환사 중에서 Selenia Sky 골드 카드입니다. 마켓에서 가장 저렴하게 거래되고 있는 것이 3250불이네요.. ㅎㄷㄷ</p>

<h2>3. 결론 </h2>
오늘은 카드의 카테고리에 대해서 알아봤습니다. 이제는 부스터팩 사서 누르면 적어도 내 카드가 좋은지 안좋은지 정도는 알고 열어볼 수 있게 되었네요. ㅎㅎㅎ..다음 포스팅은 카드 레벨업에 대해서 알아보도록 하겠습니다.

<p>안녕하세요 @jayplayco 입니다. 재미있고 관심있는 프로젝트들은 깊숙히 파고 들어가서 파헤치는 취미는 참 다양한 분들을 만나게 하는 활동인것 같아요. 이번에는 스팀몬스터측 파운더와 선이 닿아서 이것 저것 물어보고 한국 커뮤니티에도 조금더 활성화되었으면 한다고 해서 약 3개월전에 런칭한 스팀몬스터라는 스팀기반 카드게임을 “다시” 소개하고자 합니다. ^^</p>
<p>개인적으로는 카드형게임들을 많이 즐기지는 않습니다만, 가장 중요한 이유는 사실상 쉽게 빠져들어서 헤어나오기 힘들어서인 것이 이지요 ^^ ㅎㅎ..</p>

<h2>1. 스팀몬스터란</h2>
스팀몬스터는 블리자드의 하스스톤과 비슷한 느낌의 게임성을 지향하는 블록체인 기반의 일명 크립토 컬렉티브 (crypto collective) 입니다. 일반 카드게임과의 차별점은 카드 구매시 소유권이 스팀 블록체인에 기록되는 관계로 실제로 카드를 소유하고, 판매가 가능합니다.

<h2> 2. 스팀몬스터 현재까지 개발상황</h2>
a. 2018년 5월 26일 - 스티몬스터 알파 릴리즈 및 카드팩 프리세일 시작 - 구매 STEEM 및 SBD로 가능
b. 2018년 6월 1일  - 부스터팩 1만개 판매 완료 (개당 2불) - 한사람당 정말 많이 사더군요.
c. 2018년 6월 8일  - 스타터팩 1천개 판매 완료 (개달 5불) - 스팀몬스터 보유 유저 1000명임.
d. 2018년 6월 14일 - 골드호일 카드 소개 (같은 카드에 골드표기, 희귀카드)
e. 2018년 6월 23일 - 카드팩 BTC, LTC와 ETH로 추가 구매가능
f. 2018년 6월 26일 - *스팀몬스터 스타터팩 구매시 스팀 계정 무료생성 가능!* - 지금은 신용카드까지 되어서 쉽게 생성가능.
g. 2018년 7월 14일 - 스팀몬스터 마켓 오픈, 공식적으로 카드 구매/교환 가능하게 됨.
h. 2018년 8월 3일 - 부스터팩 10만개 판매 완료~
i. 2018년 8월 23일 - 스팀몬스터 게임플레이 논리 공개

<h2> 3. 스팀몬스터 앞으로 개발 상황 </h2>
a. 2018년 9월 초- 스팀몬스터 Kickstarter 진행
b. 2018년 9월~10월 - 스팀몬스터 배틀 게임 시작

<center>https://youtu.be/9QZ8gi3WPZY  </center>

<h2> 4. 스팀몬스터의 가능성</h2>

<p>사실 스팀몬스터는 현재까지는 한국 외의 지역에서 상당히 유행하는 스팀내의 D’app입니다. 이는 영문만 쓸 수 있는 접근성의 문제도 있지만, 아무래도 덜 알려져있어서 그런 현상이 있는것 같기도 합니다. 스팀 몬스터 카드를 사서 게임을 통한 업그레이드도 가능하고, 토너먼트를 통한 STEEM/SBD/부스터팩과 같은 상품을 받을 수 있는 시스템이라서 카드댁을 어느정도 소유하고 있는 유저가 유리할 것이라고 봅니다.</p>
<p>또한 실제로 마켓에서 일부 카드들은 800USD도 넘는 가격으로 거래되기도 했습니다. 현재 스팀몬스터가 알파용 카드를 판매하고 있고, 베타로 넘어갈 경우 알파용 카드의 판매를 중단한다고 합니다. 거기서 추가적으로 가격상승 용인이 될 것으로 보입니다. 모든 스팀몬스터내 거래나 카드의 발행량등은 <a href="http://steemmonstersdb.com/에서">http://steemmonstersdb.com/에서</a> 확인가능합니다.</p>
<h2> 5. 이벤트는 성공리에 마감되었습니다.</h2>

<p>첫 이벤트는 복잡하면 안되니, 간단하게 가겠습니다. ^^ </p>
<ol>
<li>리스팀하시고 </li>
<li>댓글 남겨주세요. 선착순으로 40분께 쏘겠습니다. ㅎㅎ(부계정 확인되면 빼겠습니다. ^^;)</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://steemmonsters.com/">스팀몬스터에 포스팅키</a>로 로그인을 한번 하셔야 합니다. 안그러면 보내드릴 수가 없어요 ^^</p>
<p>메뉴얼로 열심히 보내드려야 해서 다 보내드리기까진 조금 시간이 걸릴 수 있습니다. </p>
<p>그럼 모두 행복한 월욜 시작이요~!</p>

<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.<br>Steemhunt has now started its private token sale, and we can see a different kind of spirit when reading the announcements from Steemhunt.<br>Announcement <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@steemhunt/introducing-hunt-platform-front-page-for-product-influencers-and-makers-by-token-economy">here</a>.</p>
<p>To all readers who are new to <a href="https://steemhunt.com/">Steemhunt</a>, Steemhunt is a service built on the Steem platform to enable Hunters to hunt new and cool products and get rewarded on a daily base.  If you are new to Steemhunt, you should try first this post. <a href="https://steemit.com/steemdev/@steemhunt/introducing-steemhunt-daily-ranking-of-effortlessly-cool-products-fueled-by-steem-blockchain">LINK</a></p>
<p>In that mentioned announcement above, there is a part talking about the whitepaper, and here I would go in detail what Steemhunt is actually doing and what Steemhunt is thinking about their whitepaper. </p>

<h2> 1. What is a whitepaper?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>.. white papers are long-form content designed to promote the products or services from a specific company. As a marketing tool, these papers use selected facts and logical arguments to build a case favorable to the company sponsoring the document. B2B (business-to-business) white papers are often used to generate sales leads, establish thought leadership, make a business case, or inform and persuade prospective customers, channel partners, journalists, analysts, or investors.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper">Source: wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in the end, it is a piece of paper explaining what you are trying to do to people or organizations who might be interested in your project. In the case of cryptocurrencies, starting with Bitcoin, which also had a whitepaper explaining the concept of cryptocurrencies, this whitepaper has become a reliable marketing tool for recent ICO’s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a big difference in quality between whitepapers from <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/blob/master/drafts/%5Benglish%5D-old-ethereum-whitepaper.md">Ethereum</a> to most of the whitepapers from current ICO`s. Bitcoin and Ethereum’s whitepapers are explaining in technical detail about their philosophy and have set a real difference in the execution of their cryptocurrency environment. But compared to that, a lot of today’s cryptocurrency whitepapers are just drawing a picture of something or are just using it really like a pure marketing tool to fool the mass. Partly there are even debacles with <a href="https://coincentral.com/community-accuses-tron-plagiarizing-whitepaper/">plagiarism for whitepapers</a>, and here we are talking about a cryptocurrency with over one million coin holders. </p>
<h2> 2. Why does an ICO need a whitepaper?</h2>

<p>ICOs need a whitepaper as a marketing tool, so they can explain their vision to potential investors (who may not know too much about it) and collect the money for their project. </p>
<p>Let’s try to point it down with an imaginary project. Imagine I want to …. hmmm. Revolutionize the drinking water supply with cryptocurrency. Sounds interesting and would help the world with a fair water supply.<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQYX2iijYKLUCKMbuHtmjHygFkYGXstBAJiuGtxdGPWcn/image.png" alt=""><br><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/DWA7AFbJGgI">Source: Christian Chen</a></p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Water distribution is not fair in the world.</li>
<li>Issue Tokens for every 1l consumed of water to everybody in the delivery chain. (Manufacturer - Distributor - Wholesaler - Retailer - Consumer)</li>
<li>That Token can be used to pay each one in the chain.</li>
<li>Make a Token distribution system giving different values to each one in the chain. (Like a bad manufacturer who is hunting down the water resources of a country gets only a little or no Tokens and also the Consumer who drinks that kind of water) </li>
<li>Empower the weak ones or good suppliers of water. </li>
</ol>
<p>So, now I have my story, a product, and an economy.  (After writing this story I googled water and cryptocurrency together, and there are projects based on water and please be informed that I am not referring to that projects.)</p>
<p>There are tons of problems in realizing this project, and it is questionable if the tokens could solve the problem for water distribution at all, but the following is sure.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is not that difficult to make my Tokens. As an example with Tron, I need only 1024 Tron tokens (a value of about 30USD at the moment) to create my own “Watersupply Token.” It is done with the click of a button and some parameters input. </li>
<li>I need to put easy to understand pictures and graphs into my whitepaper and also get some renowned names into my team or as an advisor (preferred then paid in my Tokens) and the market to recover a bit.</li>
<li>With enough marketing efforts, I can then start my ICO.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTm2N2WHL9YHWf9h8hV3HFjaKc9KU7MuefmHC5MUMqbsc/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Sounds unrealistic? Of course, there are a lot of legit projects with grand visions, teams, and process. But unfortunately, there are over 1,800 cryptocurrencies listed at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">Coinmarketcap</a> and still, more which did not make it into the list of Coinmarketcap. And a lot of these projects have nothing more than a piece of paper when collecting the money for their projects. And even more of them will probably fail to deliver what they have promised in their whitepaper. But when we have a bull market (may not in the current bearish situation) the mass jumps on everything that the keyword “crypto” on it. We had seen that with the IT wave for “www” and also last year when the market was bullish. </p>
<h2> 3. So where can I find the whitepaper from Steemhunt?</h2>

<p>To make it clear, there is no whitepaper from Steemhunt. And I don`t think that Steemhunt will decide shortly to make a whitepaper, or at all.</p>
<p>Before getting into details why there is no whitepaper, I would also like to refer to a <a href="https://medium.com/loom-network/loom-network-wheres-your-whitepaper-5c5c9075af72">text from Loom Networks</a> where Dilanka McLovin explained why they have no whitepaper for Loom Networks. Long story short, there is no whitepaper because they decided to use their resources to ship code instead of writing long, meaningless marketing whitepapers. </p>
<p>It is similar for Steemhunt and let’s dive into the details.</p>
<ul>
<li>Steemhunt has currently a small core team of two developers and a project manager who also acts as a designer. They have proven in the last three month that they can adapt their product fast to new circumstances and have continued to pivot the platform’s system to engage more users. </li>
<li>This pivots includes the adaptation for Moderator roles, ABV, Diversity Score, ABV 2.0, Influencer Role and Hunter Levels. </li>
<li>Additionally, a flourishing community with almost 30  members in a community role and over 200 Steem Power Sponsors backing the project. </li>
<li>Steemhunt is building its service based on Steem and SMT, from the technical side it would be enough to refer to the <a href="https://steem.io/steem-whitepaper.pdf">Steem whitepaper</a> and <a href="https://smt.steem.io/smt-whitepaper.pdf">SMT whitepaper</a>. </li>
<li>The vision itself is to create a Platform of three services called Steemhunt, Reviewhunt, and Ideahunt. (Also explained in detail <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@jayplayco/steemhunt-smt-and-steemhunts-relation">here</a>)</li>
<li>To understand Steemhunt the best way you need to see the live product and interact as a Hunter. That is way better than an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), a prototype or a piece of paper. </li>
</ul>
<p>After meeting @tabris (Main Dev) in person a few times and talking with @project7 (Design), it is for sure that this team is laser-focusing their resources in developing the platform and community and nothing else. As Dilanka McLovin mentioned in his post, “Loom Networks is building a product more like the city of Paris looking like a spaghetti monster from the top than a modern and organized city like Brasilia to make a product that people like and want to use.”<a href="https://medium.com/loom-network/loom-network-wheres-your-whitepaper-5c5c9075af72">Source: Dilanka McLovin</a>  My conclusion is that Steemhunt is very similar and most likely too busy to ship out the code and take care of the community so that the user can enjoy the platform than to sit down and write a whitepaper.</p>
<p>Although, as mentioned in the beginning, Steemhunt released a few days ago a subpage on Steemhunt as one-pager giving a fast and quick overlook into the numbers and vision of Steemhunt.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmc7CY2gQsG5sKTpES9Y9zLirtEXPRjCght2E7YD3EtLvQ/image.png" alt=""><br><a href="https://token.steemhunt.com/">Source: Steemhunt</a></p>
<p>You can find the page under <a href="https://token.steemhunt.com/">https://token.steemhunt.com/</a> to understand what @tabris and @project7 are planning to ship out.</p>
<h2>2. Conclusion</h2>
We will still have a lot of fun with the HF-20 release soon and will get an own sign-up interface based on that. That will give Steemhunt the opportunity to attract users outside of Steem. This will have a huge impact not only for Steemhunt but also for Steem (as other projects will also start with HF-20 to have their own signup system) itself and in my humble opinion it is much better to have a live product running with a healthy community to get users and investors on board than a long piece of paper.

<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.<br>Steemit Inc. has finally announced after the launch date of HF20 the <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@steemitblog/smts-release-dates">dates for the test and main net of SMT</a>. It is currently planned for the 15th of January to finish the development and launch the Testnet and fully release the Mainnet on Steem at 24th of March.  </p>
<p>To all readers who are new to <a href="https://steemhunt.com/">Steemhunt</a>, Steemhunt is a service built on the Steem platform to enable Hunters to hunt new and cool products and get rewarded on a daily base.  If you are new to Steemhunt, you should try first this post. <a href="https://steemit.com/steemdev/@steemhunt/introducing-steemhunt-daily-ranking-of-effortlessly-cool-products-fueled-by-steem-blockchain">LINK</a></p>
<p>We will go into detail what the SMT launch means to Steemhunt and what the next steps would be, what could change and what kind of advantages we could see. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Proof-of-Brain’<br>community incentives<br>Proof-of-Brain is a type of tokens rewards algorithm that encourages people to create and curate content.</p>
<p>It enables tokens to be distributed by “upvote” and “like”-based algorithms and can be integrated with websites to align &gt;incentives between application owners and community members to spur growth.<br><a href="https://smt.steem.io/">Source: steem.io</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The core here is that you can quickly start your service based on Proof-of-Brain type tokens, which is actually what Steemhunt is currently preparing. Based on curations and upvotes from the community, content (for Steemhunt it would be hunts) can be rewarded and also the curators can be paid. It would be difficult to either create an own token economy or make it based on systems like Ethereum or Tron as the Proof-of-Brain algorithm would need to be developed on their own. (Of course, this kind of economic systems have their advantages, as there are free from any limitations so that you can build your Token economy as open as possible)</p>
<p>You can either decide to stay on the Steem network or use the SMT and wallet function on the blockchain to run your SMT on the background (so that the user does not know that he is using the Steem Blockchain to get rewarded.</p>
<p>One of the significant advantages SMT developers and users will have is the direct and immediate access to a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) with an Anchor currency as Steem. As this exchange is decentralized, you don`t even need a middleman to get your tokens changed. There are still a lot of coins and tokens launched with their environment, and it is difficult for them to get launched into an exchange without having the right connections or tractions. In some cases, you can see even market transfers for coins or Tokens based on P2P, like in the beginnings for Bitcoin. With SMT, your users will have the possibility to trade their SMT based Tokens on the DEX directly into Steem. Another good advantage is that the DEX will be without any fees so that you can trade very quickly without any loss.</p>
<h2> 2. What changes brings SMT to Steemhunt? </h2>

<p>The following parts are scenarios of what could be done based on the launch of SMT with Steemhunt. I will divide the sections into possible scenarios and parts that will happen.</p>
<h3> 1) Changes that will happen with SMT</h3>
<h4> Hunt Coin will be swapped from ERC-20 to SMT</h4>
  * The Steemhunt team is currently preparing the launch of ERC-20 Tokens based on Ethereum to make it possible to transfer Hunt tokens if needed.
  * After the start of SMT in March 2019 it will be swapped from ERC-20 into SMT Hunt Tokens

<h4> Hunt Tokens will be tradeable at DEX </h4>  
  * When the community overgrows after HF20, it could happen that the Hunt Tokens will be launched in an Exchange before SMT.
  * After the final launch of SMT the Hunt Tokens will be swapped from ERC-20 Tokens into SMT Hunt Tokens and based on that tradeable on the DEX into Steem.

<h4> Hunt Tokens Airdrop will end</h4>
  * The current airdrop of Hunt Tokens will stop and will switch to regular Hunt Tokens distribution in the Hunt Economy.

<h4> Hunt Tokens will start to inflate</h4>
  * As the Hunt tokens need to rewarded to Hunters (as in Steemit, busy, etc. with Steem) the Hunt Tokens are going to start to inflate based on the launch of SMT and swap of the Tokens from ERC-20
  * This means that the Hunt Tokens are going to be increased in volume over time. It is not yet communicated if there is a burning mechanism implemented for example partly for Steem.

<h4> Reviewhunt and Ideahunt can be launched in whole</h4>
  * Steemhunt is not only about hunting products, but the team is preparing a whole economy based on the Hunt Tokens.
  * Reviewhunt and Ideahunt are additional Services in the Steemhunt economy to enable an internal flow of usage.
  * Hunters will be able to earn tokens on Steemhunt, Reviewhunt and based on the Tokens spend them on Ideahunt.
  * Companies can call out bounties for Hunters to review their products with high quality and would be able to launch new products on the Ideahunt platform.
  * This will be possible as the Hunt Tokens will be based on SMT and it will be easy and without any fees to transfer or trade Tokens.

<h3> 2) Possible Scenarios with SMT</h3>
<h4> Steemhunt could split totally from Steemit</h4>
  With SMT it is possible to use the Steemblockchain hidden in the background. Due to the lack of SMT in the current moment, Steemhunt is saving the content (Hunts) on their server and pushing it directly also to the Blockchain. Without SMT there is no other possibility to use the Steem economy and the reward-based upvote algorithm as to push the content to Steem and use Steem for the reward system. WIth SMT that can still be done the same way (Pushing the content to the Blockchain) but is not anymore a necessity to use SMT based Tokens. So theoretically Steemhunt could decide to stop pushing the content to the Blockchain and use only the Steem blockchain and Token economy in the background. Other SMT's could also determine on a similar way, as using the Steemit environment has many advantages but also limits the userbase on the Steem community which brings a Steemit based behavior, which is not always helpful for a ranking based community. SMT will be the turning point for many SMT`s to decide to keep the Steemit environment or not and it will be judged based on the pro&con's that coming with that decision.

<h4> Steemhunt could create an own user registration</h4>
  This is more related to HF20 and with the fact that so-called Resource Credits will be created to make it easier for new users to onboard on Steem or SMT based services. One of the difficulties for services based on Steem is the limitation of a user base, which is for a product-driven Blockchain product like Steem really big, but for scalability on mass is still a barrier, as it is difficult for average users to understand the Steemit like environment and add to that a service like Steemhunt. Decoupling the service from the Blockchain and using only the SMT in the background, as mentioned above, still requires to log in on the Steem blockchain to be able to use the SMT based functionalities. With HF-20, SMT and an own Resource Credit based user registration it would be possible to onboard new users without the difficulty to understand Steem or Steemit and start as any social media service without a blockchain in behind.

<p>  This would decrease the learning curve of the current Steemhunt system dramatically, as the user does not need to understand Steem or Steemit and would make it possible to start marketing activities to promote Steemhunt to the mass as the onboarding will be similarly easy as other traditional services.</p>

[Source: Steemhunt](https://token.steemhunt.com/)

<p>Steemhunt is going to expand into total three different services. Steemhunt as a service is the current live product which the community is using. Review hunt will be kind of a marketplace mainly for seasoned and professional hunters and brands(makers) who want their products reviewed. Compared to the service Steemhunt where we say that it is not a writing competition but a short description is enough, with Review hunt we will see hunters with quality reviews going for the bounty from the brands(makers). </p>
<p>The economy is already starting with Reviewhunt, as a brand(maker) would need to earn hunts on the platform or purchase hunt tokens to increase the bounty. This would be the moment where Steemhunt would need in the beginning also a team for contacting the brands and suggesting them to join Steemhunt for a review.</p>
<p>Ideahunt would be a final cycle where brands(makers) could run a campaign like Kickstarter to get exposure for their products and also be able to presale their products. Kickstarter like platforms are incredibly successful as they have an audience appealing for that kind of new approaches. Steemhunt’s hunters would cover at least the same audience when not even a more sophisticated target group with love and passion for cool and new products. The most important part would be, that the customers from Ideahunt would be able to buy the products with Hunt Tokens, so there could be a cycle where a hunter is earning Hunt tokens with hunting products and doing reviews and spending the tokens later on Ideahunt for real products. </p>
<p>These services mean that without even an exchange there will be an independent token flow within the Steemhunt economy.<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmci9F8uFj97gzVDnUMq7sUgM45daGaojSQmBEA4jRcPnf/image.png" alt=""><br><a href="https://token.steemhunt.com/">Source: Steemhunt</a></p>
<h2> 4. Expectation and growth </h2>

<p>As it is crucial for Steemhunt to create their economy and make it also attractive for brands(makers) it is needed to grow the community to a respectful size. With SMT and HF20 based on a separate User registration service and marketing activities outside of Steem, this will be a reasonable goal to achieve. Steemhunt has already a DAU over 2k within the Steem Blockchain, and I think that growing the user base further and getting brands(makers) on board will be not an easy job, but a very manageable job from the team and community behind Steemhunt.</p>
<h2>2. Conclusion</h2>
So Steemit Inc. has now put out some exact dates for SMT, and all SMT project owners are happy that they now have something to work. Steemhunt is one of these SMT projects. We started with ABV iterations before any other project and also distributing Tokens for swapping before the SMT launch to gain the trust and interest of the community. It will be an interesting road until the launch of HF20 and SMT, and please stay tuned for Steemhunt as we will be one of the first on that road. :)

<p>안녕하세요, @jayplayco 입니다. 스팀헌트가 드디어 1:1 스팀대비 헌트토큰 에어드랍 기능을 활성화 해서 작일 저녁에 공지를 했습니다. 자세한 사항은 @project7 님의 <a href="https://steemit.com/kr/@project7/1-1">공지</a>를 보시면 자세하게 설명되어 있습니다. </p>
<p>하기는 현재까지 자주 나왔던 질문사항에 대한 답변을 정리해드렸습니다.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q. 헌트토큰 받으려면 어떻게 해야하나요?</strong><br>  A. 프로젝트7님이 올리신 <a href="https://steemit.com/kr/@project7/1-1">공지</a>를 보고 스텝 바이 스텝으로 따라하시면 쉽습니다. ^^ </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. 헌트토큰의 가치는 어떻게 되나요?</strong><br>  A. 헌트 토큰은 아직 스팀헌트내 지갑에서 빼는 기능이 활성화되지 않았습니다. 결국 가격이라는 것은 시장이 결정하는 관계로 tranfer가 되지 않는 헌트 토큰의 가치를 추정하기란 어렵습니다. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. 그럼 헌트 토큰은 언제부터 옮길 수 있나요?</strong><br>  A. 현재 ERC-20 기반 지갑 기능을 2018년 9월 20일 주에 (8월26일까지 기다려야하겠네요 ^^) 활성화할 예정입니다. 활성화가 된 후 헌트 토큰을 ERC-20 기반 지갑으로 이동이 가능해지십니다. 예를 들어 myetherwallet같은 지갑이 해당이 됩니다. 헌트 토큰 이동후 그 지갑에는 소량의 이더리움이 있어야지 (Gas비용) 나중에 헌트 토큰을 다시 이동할 수 있습니다. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. ERC-20기능이 활성화 되면 헌트 토큰을 꼭 다른 지갑으로 이동해야 하나요?</strong><br>  A. 그렇지는 않습니다. 결국 최종적인 목표는 ERC-20 Token은 임시 방편으로 발행하는 것이고, 최종적으로는 SMT 토큰으로 스와핑이 목적이기 때문입니다. 현 시점에서는 스와핑을 위해 가장 손쉬운 방법은 그냥 스팀헌트 지갑에 보관되어 있을 경우에 ERC-20토큰에서 SMT 토큰으로 스와핑이 간편할 것으로 보입니다. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. 헌트토큰은 그럼 거래소에 언제 등록이 되는것인가요?</strong><br>  A. 스팀헌트 커뮤니티가 충분히 성장했을 때 자동적으로 거래소에 등록이 될 것이라고 판단됩니다. 스팀헌트 측에서는 거래소 상장을 위해 추가적인 자금(토큰)을 할애할 계획이 없는 관계로 지속적으로 제품개발및 커뮤니티 개발에 리소스를 집중할 예정입니다. 결국은 건강하고 규모가 있는 커뮤니티가 헌트 토큰의 빠른 상장에 도움이 될것으로 판단됩니다. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. 이미 헌트 토큰을 일부 소유하고 있는데, 이번 에어드랍은 추가적으로 주는 것인가요?</strong></p>
<pre><code>A. 네, 추가적으로 드랍되는 물량입니다. </code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Q. 토큰을 클레임했는데, 다음주에 SP가 늘어서 또다시 클레임을 할 수 있나요?</strong><br>   A. 안됩니다, 클레임은 1회에 한해서 가능합니다. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. 에어드랍은 먼저오는 사람이 임자라고 들었습니다. 즉 물량이 한정되어 있는것인가요?</strong><br>  A. 네, 물량은 한정되어 있습니다만, 1억 토큰을 준배놓은 상황이라 이 물량은 현재 전체 유저 SP와 거의 맞먹습니다. (조금 적습니다. ^^) 그래서 너무 걱정은 하지 않아도 되지만, 스팀헌트측에서 에어드랍 기간을 1달로 정해서 2018년 9월 13일날 SP 클레임 에어드랍은 끝나게 됩니다. 너무 오래 기다리는 것은 기회를 놓칠 수 있을 확률이 있습니다. ^^ 가능한 SP를 가득 채우셔서 클레임을 하시는 것을 추천드립니다. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>헌트 토큰은 <a href="https://steemhunt.com/">www.steemhunt.com</a>에 가셔서 스팀커넥트로 로그인 하시고 “Wallet”에 가셔서 클레임을 하시면 됩니다. 모두모두 헌트 토큰 부자가 되시길~~</p>

<p>Hi, @jayplayco here with a fast update about the new Airdrop for SP holders from Steemhunt and with the most asked questions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q. How can I claim my Hunt tokens for SP</strong><br>  A. Please read the <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@steemhunt/hunt-token-airdrop-for-sp-holders-is-live-now-or-steemhunt-sponsor-report-16">announcements </a>from @steemhunt as it is explained there.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. What is the value of the Hunt Token?</strong><br>  A. The Hunt tokens are not yet transferable, so there can’t exactly a price be measured at the moment, and the end prices are made from the market.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. When will the token be transferable?</strong><br>  A. It is planned for the week of the 20th of September (so it could take up to the 26th of September.) to make the Hunt token ready for ERC-20. You would then be able to move your Hunt Tokens to a personal ERC-20 compatible wallet. After moving it out to an ERC-20 Wallet, you will need a small Amount of Ethereum for Gas to move it back to somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. Do I have to move the Hunt tokens when the ERC-20 is available?</strong><br>  A. Not really, as the primary plan is at the end to swap the Hunt Tokens later to SMT tokens, which will be in the moment most comfortable when they are still in the Steemhunt wallet. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. When are Hunt Tokens listed on an exchange?</strong><br>  A. It will be done automatically when we have enough community power. Steemhunt is not planning to pay exchanges for listings like other partly scammy ICO’s without a product behind and will further continue to ship code and develop the product and the community. So the answer is, bring in more great hunters into our community and you will see your hunt tokens grow faster and be listed more quickly on an exchange.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. Are the airdrop tokens for my SP added to the Hunt Tokens I already have?</strong><br>  A. Yes, they are added.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. When I claim my Tokens now and have more SP next week, can I claim again?</strong><br>  A. No, it is a one Time claim only.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q. I heard the Airdrop is first come first serve, will I be too late?</strong><br>  A. Don’t worry too much about that, as the airdrop is covering 100M Hunt tokens, which is almost equivalent to the SP’s hold by users (excluding Steemit Inc holdings). But the Airdrop runs for only one month and will be finished on September 13th 2018, so you should not wait too long for claiming your Hunt Tokens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what you are waiting for? Move to <a href="https://steemhunt.com/">www.steemhunt.com</a> and claim your Hunt Tokens now!</p>

<p>정말 간단한 요약은 증인이신 @clayop님의 글 참조를 추천드리며. </p>

</ul>
<p>그리고 언제나 가장 자세하게 자신의 생각과 함께 정리를 주시는 @wonsama 님의 글을 보시면 전체 요약을 다 보실 수 있습니다.</p>

</ul>
<p>저의 경우는 이번 하드포크 20을 보면서 드는 생각은 많은 부분이 있지만, 특히 계정 생성을 조금더 쉽게 할 수 있다는 것에 집중조명을 하고자 합니다.</p>
<h2> 계정생성 변경 사항 </h2>
원사마님의 요약번역을 우선 살펴보도록 하겠습니다. 

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>계정생성 변경 (Updates to Account Creation)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1.1<strong>할인된 계정 생성 (Discounted Account Creation)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>기존) STEEM 지불(3스팀), SP임대(2주걸린것)</li>
<li>HF20 이후 추가) RC를 사용하여 계정 생성이 가능해 짐.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.2 할인된 계정생성 토큰 (Discount Account Creation Tokens)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>매일 증인에 의해 할인계정 생성용 토큰이 발행됨(총량이 정해져 있음)</li>
<li>계정 생성용 토큰 교환 수 또한 증인에 의해 통제됨</li>
<li>RC를 소비하여 계정을 생성하는 경우 토큰이 사용됨(토큰이 다 소비되면 RC가 있어도 계정생성 불가)<br><a href="https://steemit.com/kr/@wonsama/20-steem-velocity-hardfork-hardfork-20">Source: @wonsama 님 번역</a></li>
</ul>

<p>우선 변경되는 것이 RC (Resource Credit)라는 것을 새로 발행하게 됩니다. 이를 이용해서 계정 생성시 1-3주까지 기다려야 계정이 생성되는 것을 거의 즉각 생성 가능하게 됩니다. RC라는 토큰을 이용해 스팀을 대체해서 할인된 계정을 생성할 수 있습니다. 즉, 스팀을 쓰지 않고 계정 생성이 된다는 것이죠. <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@steemitblog/blockchain-update-4-resource-credit-implementation-details">Source: steemit</a></p>
<p>여기서 한가지 걸리는 것은, 완전 외부의 사용자가 처음으로 스팀잇, 비지, 스팀kr이나 DAPP인 테이스팀이나 스팀헌트 같은 곳에 처음와서 계정 가입시도를 했을 때, 그 신규 가입자는 스팀도, RC도 없는 상태이기 때문에 결국 누군가가 RC를 대신 내줘야지 빠른 가입이 될 것으로 예상이 됩니다. 즉, 스팀잇이 그동안 계정을 새로 열었을 때 스팀을 델레게이션하던 방식에서 스팀파워에 따라 간접적으로 생성되는 RC로 일명 할인된 계정을 생성할 수 있는 상황이 될 것으로 보입니다.</p>
<p><strong>예상시나리오</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>고래들은 알트를 쉽게 생성할 수 있을것이다. (또다시 파는 행위가 나올지도…?)</li>
<li>프로젝트형 고래들은 (스팀잇, 유토피안, 테이스팀, 스팀헌트, 등) RC 발행에 따른 유저 유입을 위해 할인된 가입절차를 offer 할 확률이 높다. (이미 스팀잇, 유토피안등은 하고 있음) </li>
<li>피라미사용자의 경우는 이전과 비슷하게 부계정이나 계정을 추가로 만드는 것은 쉽지 않을 것으로 보인다.</li>
</ul>
<p>결국은 이것은 스팀과 스팀달러를 쓰지 않고 계정생성이 가능할 수 있도록 계정 생성용 RC 토큰을 새로 만든것으로 사료되기는 합니다.</p>
<h2> 그래도 이것이 왜 SMT를 위해 중요한가? </h2>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSNn8Cp1q7XcQTen4FVDWDuesQhLdbemjv1gxkZqkncAP/image.png)

<p>스팀의 계정수는 1백만을 넘어섰지만서도 DAU를 따진다면 훨씬 적은 숫자가 될 것으로 보입니다. 한국 KR 커뮤니티도 상당히 활발한 것으로 알려져 있어 @Dan조차도 한국까지 날라왔지만, 이리 저리 따져봐도 500-700명 안팍의 유저들이 열심히 활동하고 키우고 있는것으로 추정됩니다.</p>
<p>@lucky2님이 몇일전에 뉴비들의 접근은 더욱더 용이하게 하기 위해서 <a href="https://steemit.com/kr/@lucky2/2qrhh1">한국에서 가장 접근성이 좋은 네이x에 카페를</a> 차려서 뉴비들을 위한 정착소를 만드는 것도 이런 외부 사용자들의 유입을 늘리기 위한 노력의 일환중 하나입니다. </p>
<p>하지만 현재와 같은 HF19상황에서는 가입을 하려고 해도 2주이상을 기다려야 하니, 관심을 갖다가도 지쳐서 잊고 지내게 됩니다. 사실상 생각해보면 인터넷에서 물건 주문하고 2주가 지나면 주문한지 조차 잊는 시간이기 때문입니다. ㅎㅎ..</p>
<p>럭키님의 뉴비 정착및 유입을 위한 카페활동이던, 테이스팀이나 스팀헌트 같은 댑들이 성장을 위해 필수적으로 필요한 외부 사용자들의 쉬운 유입을 위해서는 HF20의 RC는 그래서 가입장벽을 없애지는 못하겠지만 현재와 비교해서는 거의 허물 수 있다고 볼 수 있습니다.</p>
<p>아마도 미래 플랜으로 볼때는, 테이스팀과 스팀헌트도 RC 토큰 기반의 자체 계정 가입 프로세스를 (프로젝트형 고래이기 때문에 가능할것으로 보임, 아직 확실하지 않은 것은 델레게이션을 받은 스팀파워로도 같은 RC가 생성되는지는 100% 확신이 없음) 갖춰서 외부 유저 유입에 힘을 써야 할 것으로 보이며, 심지어 럭키님의 카페 프로젝트 조차도<br>외부 유저들의 유입을 더욱 쉽게 하기 위해서는 자체 가입용 계정을 운용하는 것도 고민을 해볼만 할 것으로 보입니다.</p>

<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.<br>We are running the Hunter Level now for a few days, and a lot of parts have been tweaked in these days and still are tweaked. After two weeks of introduction hunters still, find it difficult to understand the hunter level itself and how they should adapt to it.</p>
<p>To all readers who are new to <a href="https://steemhunt.com/">Steemhunt</a>, Steemhunt is a service built on the platform Steem to enable Hunters to hunt new and cool products and get rewarded on a daily base.  If you are new to Steemhunt, you should try first this post. <a href="https://steemit.com/steemdev/@steemhunt/introducing-steemhunt-daily-ranking-of-effortlessly-cool-products-fueled-by-steem-blockchain">LINK</a></p>
<p>We will go into details about what the <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@steemhunt/steemhunt-abv-2-0-introducing-hunter-level-based-steemhunt-upvotes-or-new-category-search-feature">new Hunter Level</a> means and what kind of actions are counted for the score. A detailed post about ABV 2.0 can be found <a href="https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@jayplayco/steemhunt-abv-2-0">here</a>.</p>
<h2> 0. Repository </h2>

<h2> 1. Hunters Level - Why?</h2>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYQaGSSwfJJsCS9fhjaXfkdTHjp9nbRJRXG8UbPTona2A/image.png)

<p>Steemhunt is building on the Steem environment, and specific behaviors have been adapted which were not helpful to create a good ranking board. Circle voting, using Alt accounts to upvote your post and manipulate the ranking, V4V attempts from larger groups and much more made the ranking board a playground for abusers. Even the Pro-Con review rewards were abused by users working whole day making partly hundreds of comments to increase the chance of an upvote.</p>
<p>At that time the first place on the ranking board from Steemhunt was able to get voting over 120$ for one post when getting the first rank. Few of the manipulation attempts were even quite successful, so the team needed to react to find a way to reduce or block this kind of manipulation. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, until ABV 2.0 having the ranking board and rewards coupled together with, the abusers always found another way to manipulate the ranking board. It was seen from a social behavior point of view fascinating to look into it but still, an issue as it would make the ranking board not attractive and fun.</p>
<p>After de-coupling the ranking board and rewards (upvoting) with ABV 2.0 there was a system needed to be able to reward the hunters still. So the Hunters Level based on the Steemhunt User Score was born. </p>
<h2> 2. The four columns of User Score</h2>
![](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmS3d6CeUQ2Lf1opvFeZ5iviUhKv7SsL7HJF8tJYw2go1f/image.png)

<p>Hunter Levels are based on the User Score, and the User Score is calculated based on different parameters. The User Score is also used as Voting Power on the Steemhunt platform.</p>
<h3> 1) Account Credibility</h3>
In the current moment, two factors are calculated, which is the reputation score from Steem (then number right to your nickname is representing it)  and the age of your account in Steemhunt.

<h3> 2) Activity Score </h3>
Also here in the moment, the login record is calculated on a daily base.  This record adds or deducts every day.

<h3> 3) Curation Score  </h3>
Curation activities are upvoting hunts from other hunters within Steemhunt (and not from Steemit or busy or somewhere else). This also includes the total curation weight and [voting diversity](https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@steemhunt/steemhunt-s-account-based-voting-ver-2-diversity-score). 

<h3> 4) Hunt Score </h3>
This point is related to the ranking of a hunted post, also if a hunt has been delisted is calculated and how good your hunt has been ranked.

<h2> 3. How to understand the User Score?</h2>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbKqewpufBu2vTnLVJEobazVPUVAxh3FXTQZygyxB7Hbo/image.png)
[Source: Element5 Digital](https://unsplash.com/photos/LTyDj7u_TU4)

<p>The current status of the Steemhunt User Score is not made to continued level up to the highest rank and stay there, but is more a real-time activity score of your Steemhunt activities. The critical point is that the data to calculate your User Score is always from the last 30 days, so everything before that doesn`t count. This time limitation has been implemented to; </p>
<p>1) Give newbies a fair chance to get established at Steemhunt<br>2) Avoid to level up and stay there (as the rewards are coupled with the User Score)<br>3) Make the User Score more an Activity Score</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSWGnoXL42HmA1iiFc1CoTv6jufDzhjedw4NiHNecbuAi/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmY3zwmSagYmQQqwKqBsiT1GGkKkFG5kAbktxAaXUcsZAt/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As a result of this implementation, a User Score can vary from one point to another quite a lot based on the activities in the last 30 days. We will go into details in the next chapter but have to keep the 30 days in mind.</p>
<h2> 4. Hacking the User Score</h2>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWxBsnbR7yfzx3HtSt6QL6xhF8eMP62R6MdiWiSY2gwkG/image.png)
[Source: Dlanor S](https://unsplash.com/photos/2xEQDxB0ss4)

<p>Hacking into the User Score is not that difficult if you have understood that the core is maintaining an excellent behavior to keep your level constant and that good results can affect your User Score positively for up to 30 days.</p>
<p>Below is the explanation from @tabris what factors are affecting the User Score. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>User Score (=Voting Power) can be</strong></p>
<p>Increased</p>
<ul>
<li>When account credibility is increased (higher reputation, older accounts)</li>
<li>When user login to Steemhunt more frequently</li>
<li>When user vote on more hunt post</li>
<li>When user vote with more weight and earlier timing on hunt posts (same curation penalty applied for the first 30 minutes of posting)</li>
<li>When user hunted, and it’s on ranked high</li>
</ul>
<p>Decreased</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user’s reputation is decreased</li>
<li>When user login to Steemhunt less frequently</li>
<li>When user vote on the same group of people many times</li>
<li>When a user does circle voting with a specific group</li>
<li>When user hunted, and it’s on ranked low</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s find the points for each of the columns in Steemhunt.</p>
<h3> 1) Account Credibility</h3>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQoDHS43NrR1zQNdDWvnWsUQ4tABSk1zz7zf6CZwFRx9Z/image.png)
>Increased
>- When account credibility is increased (higher reputation, older accounts)

<blockquote>
<p>Decreased</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user’s reputation is decreased</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To increase this point, you need to work on your reputation on Steem. Having good Hunts and get upvotes from other Hunters does help and if you managed to get to a Level 1 at Steemhunt, your Reputation at Steem would also increase step by step, when having Hunts upvoted by the Steemhunt bot. Your account does get older day by day, so this is something you don`t need to worry.</p>
<p>If you get flagged at Steem, and your reputation drops this will have a direct impact on your User Score in Steemhunt.<br>This Data is not based on the last 30 days but always on the current date when the Account Credibility is calculated.</p>
<h3> 2) Activity Score </h3>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZyt1R46YkQbVfk8dBncBwBusC2GpJTnNrVputDyESXbF/image.png)
>Increased
>- When user login to Steemhunt more frequently

<blockquote>
<p>Decreased</p>
<ul>
<li>When user login to Steemhunt less frequently</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This explanation is quite simple. Your activity Score will increase when you log in and decrease when not on a daily base. The Activity Score is also calculated based on the last 30 days so that the max Activity Score would be logging in every single day for 30 days. :)</p>
<h3> 3) Curation Score  </h3>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeKj4eSnd4vaCufYtRcsSMfdqtjvaBV5UjwXWLWZX3uNR/image.png)
>Increased
>- When user vote on more hunt post
>- When user vote with more weight and earlier timing on hunt posts (same curation penalty applied for the first 30 minutes of posting)

<blockquote>
<p>Decreased</p>
<ul>
<li>When user vote on the same group of people many times</li>
<li>When a user does circle voting with a specific group</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As we have seen being daily active at Steemhunt and increasing the reputation on Steem is substantial. But the Curation Score is something which is impacting your User Score based on your last 30 days activity.</p>
<p>As explained above you need to vote with a sufficient vote weight early enough to gain Curation Scores. Also voting on multiple hunts does increase your Curation Score. But more important is that you have to be careful not to vote on people but actual hunts and products. Behavior from Steem like “I am trailing that person so upvoting…” will harm your curation score. Even if you are only curating products, it can still happen that you are voting on the same group of people, as hunters usually develop a taste for a specific type of products and hunters as curators also. But if you keep your upvotes broad enough for all cool and new products your curation score will settle to a stable status. So keep an eye on cool hunts on Steemhunt for curation.</p>
<h3> 4) Hunt Score </h3>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmerjqFCimgL6YgLjcrH68KFzZaY4gqia5yCRY2i1MLbLH/image.png)
>Increased
>- When user hunted, and it's on ranked high

<blockquote>
<p>Decreased</p>
<ul>
<li>When user hunted, and it’s on ranked low</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Especially some of the new hunters tend to start hunting, anything without knowing what they are doing and getting de-listed their hunts very fast. :)<br>If you are one of them, I would recommend reading the posting guideline <a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md">here</a> and my last post about how to understand the posting guideline <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@jayplayco/steemhunt-understanding-the-new-posting-guideline">here</a>. The reason is, the ranking of your hunt and also delisted hunts (not accepted hunts) affect your hunt score. An excellent ranked hunt will increase your Hunt Score, but a not good performed hunt will decrease your Hunt score. Currently, you are allowed to hunt as many hunts as you wish, but still, only one accepted hunt get upvoted if your Hunter Level is above 1. The best case would be to have a daily hunt verified and ranked high on the “today’s” board. For that, you will have to be clear about what the posting guideline requests when posting a hunt and that the specific hunt will get the attention from other hunters. </p>
<p>The easy mentioned but very difficult to achieve task here is,<br><strong>“Find cool and new hunts, hunt them down before another hunter does and be sure that your hunt is matching to the posting guideline!”</strong></p>
<h2>5. So what is a good user score?</h2>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWvPtD1J5WWxJDb4ZUgwiywnoLqmQtzyz5vuvxmZkYayX/image.png)
[Source: Volkan Olmez](https://unsplash.com/photos/BVGMRRFQcf8)

<p>If you can keep a user score between 2-4 (Hunter Level 2~3), you are already a very active member of Steemhunt. From my experience in the last 14 days, everything going over a User Score of 4 tends to be very fragile for dropping in a few days as usually there had been some boosting reasons (high ranked hunts, great curation) in the last 30 days. As soon as these boosting reasons are out of the 30 days windows, the score drops to a “normal” activity level.</p>
<h2>2. Conclusion</h2>
A lot of hunters are claiming that their User Score is dropping or increasing in big steps. But that happens because all four columns of the User Score are multiplied with each other. If you have only one column under 1.0, it is going to make a big change in your total score, and if you have a difference of 0.1 in one column, it can affect your User Score up to 10-20%. 

<p>So the goal should be to maintain a Hunter Level above 1 and try to keep it between 2-3 and also to boost it with excellent activities temporarily to a higher level up to 4 or even 5. Verified Hunts on Level 4 or 5 does get a higher reward, so the motivation to boost the Level is given.</p>

<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.<br>A lot happened last week, and the most significant changes are the adaption of a separated voting system from the ranking. Additionally, the posting guideline has been trimmed to a minimum, and the voting is now done based on the hunters ranking.</p>

<p>To all readers who are new to <a href="https://steemhunt.com/">Steemhunt</a>, Steemhunt is a service built on the platform Steem to enable Hunters to hunt new and cool products and get rewarded on a daily base.  If you are new to Steemhunt, you should try first this post. <a href="https://steemit.com/steemdev/@steemhunt/introducing-steemhunt-daily-ranking-of-effortlessly-cool-products-fueled-by-steem-blockchain">LINK</a></p>
<p>This post is going into details what the <a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md">new posting guideline</a> means and what the new hunters level will have an impact for each hunter. Details about the new ABV 2.0 can be found <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@steemhunt/steemhunt-abv-2-0-introducing-hunter-level-based-steemhunt-upvotes-or-new-category-search-feature">here</a></p>

<p>Before we had up to 13 guidelines, but that is now trimmed to seven. Additionally, vague lines, which could be arguably are far more directly explained. Let`s break it down. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmR3KaxSViVzLgbrLqPyBveYTPsWb5AhChgxJMWPAdaowp/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h3> Posting Guideline Nr.1</h3>
>**1. Language - English Only**
>Steemhunt runs a single ranking board globally, so please post and comment in English. Also, the product website should be written in English. If the website offers multiple languages, please use the English page for Steemhunt.
[Source](https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#1-language---english-only)

<p><a href="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYE82GUgmWEF6CRYadeFHecR6Uhx3EiVfnf6KczMRRVj2/image.png">https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYE82GUgmWEF6CRYadeFHecR6Uhx3EiVfnf6KczMRRVj2/image.png</a> <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/jUSu0686zDM">Source: freestock.org</a></p>
<p>The Title, Subtitle, comments and also the landing page needs to be in English and only in English. Sometimes Hunters ask that their product page is non-English, but you can choose English as language. In that case, please use the right deep-link, so your product link is landing to an English site.</p>
<h3> Posting Guideline Nr.2</h3>
>**2. Types of Products to Post**
>Steemhunt generally covers unique IT or hardware products, including:
>
>2-1. Web services
>2-2. Mobile apps
>2-3. API, IT solutions, bots, open sources or other types of software
>2-4. Tech gadgets, hardware, IoT/connected/wearable devices
>2-5. Games
>2-6. Innovative Engineering/Design Products (It may cover non-tech products that have been invented based on high-level engineering/design approach to solving a significant problem)
[Source](https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#2-types-of-products-to-post)

<p>Posting Guideline two is a point where a lot of new hunters have difficulties to match the right products. Hold your breath, as we are diving into each position now.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2-1. Make sure that the service is web-based.  As an example, a consulting company with a web page is not a web service. SAAS is right or services available over the Internet (intranet).</p>
</li>
<li><p>2-2 Hunt any mobile apps available on the Appstore or Playstore. Make sure that it is not hunted already. Be aware that we appreciate the brand page rather than the Appstore or Playstore if available.</p>
</li>
<li><p>2-3 Think here about software. Opensource is good, but commercial software is also a valid hunt. If you know the right API solutions or new Bots, go for it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>2-4 Traditional gadgets, as we know them. To make it easy, check if your product has some electronic technology included. Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi, IoT or wearable technology are often hunted products.</p>
</li>
<li><p>2-5 One of the more significant changes came with Games. Before any App game with a valid Appstore link was accepted, but this resulted in too low-quality game hunts. Steemhunt is now taking only Games hunts with an own brand page. No Appstore, Playstore or Steam Link is allowed. </p>
</li>
<li><p>2-6 If you are not a seasoned hunter, this is a difficult category to fulfill. We have seen designed (paper) notebooks or paper engineered books. None of this items would be considered into the IEDP (Innovative Engineering /Design product) category, as this kind of products would be beautifully designed products or even collectibles but not an IEDP. We are verifying products which have a high degree of engineering or product design level approach to solve a problem in a new and innovative way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3> Posting Guideline Nr.3</h3>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTAfmXPfKjnBXae34xPps4Fe9dpwbYXxEv6NDr2EvKKSj/image.png)
>**3. Product Link**
>We only accept these four product links (Your post will be delisted if you include other websites than those listed below):
>
>3-1. Official product website
>3-2. Major app store link (AppStore, PlayStore, etc)
>3-3. Crowdfunding sites (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc) - The project that has failed to be pledged won't be accepted.
>3-4. Github, Bitbucket repositories for open source projects
>
>Also, the product link MUST be activated properly. If the link is broken or does not work properly, your hunt will be delisted.
[Source](https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#3-product-link)

<p>I guess this guideline is not so difficult to understand. </p>
<ul>
<li>Always look for the original brand page of the product. </li>
<li>No e-commerce site, no blog, etc. E-commerce site only, as an example, when Amazon’s Alexa is introduced (as their brand page is Amazon). </li>
<li>For Apps look for the official Playstore or Appstore link. </li>
<li>For Games go to posting guideline Nr. 7. </li>
<li>Crowdfunding sites are also accepted, but make sure that your Kickstarter has been successful. </li>
<li>Open source projects can be linked to the repositories on Github or Bitbucket. Please make sure that you choose the root of the directory.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Posting Guideline Nr.4</h3>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTVJZfc31YcURLAefWG91cTpYfUdgknHyU2PAmdNUZVve/image.png)[Source: mickey970](https://pixabay.com/de/besetzt-b%C3%BCro-ol-ans-telefon-gehen-880800/)
>**4. Plagiarism and Copyright**
>Write a short description and hunter’s comment with your own words. Do not copy and paste from the product’s website or other sites. You can, however, quote some content from a site, but you must use quotation marks and cite the source properly.
[Source](https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#4-plagiarism-and-copyright)

<p>Plagiarism is still one of the reasons many new hunters get their hunts delisted. The critical part here is <strong>use your OWN words</strong> to describe your hunt. Don’t copy and paste, don`t use content spinners (our moderators catch that also) and don’t try to rearrange few words here and there, as we usually get that too. Plagiarism is not a cavaliers delict but an illegal act and stealing copyrights from other persons. We are here to create content, not to copy it. Be careful as serial abusers are reported separately to @steemcleaners and could also result in blacklisting at Steemhunt.</p>
<p>Another tactic some users are applying is to copy and paste their material from another site than the source (product link) as like from blog entries. Our moderators are using several free and paid tools to check each text and text elements and also doing a manual check, so in standard cases, your hunt will still get delisted. </p>
<h3> Posting Guideline Nr.5</h3>
>**5. Quality of the Post**
>Steemhunt is a “product hunting” site, not a writing curation site. We have a certain format that all hunters should follow when posting a product in order to make a fair/effective ranking chart. Please follow the directions below:
>
>5-1. The field “name of product” should ONLY contain the official name of the product.
>5-2. Do not duplicate the product name or use any non-product-specific words in the field “short description.” 
>5-3. Do not attach non-related screenshot images or videos.
>5-4. Do not use low-quality product images.
>5-5. Do not share any scams, highly suspicious cryptocurrency/fin-tech, or illegal products.
>5-6. Do not share porn or anything under the nsfw category.
[Source](https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#5-quality-of-the-post)

<p>PG5 is a short guideline on how to write your hunt from the title up to the hunters’ comment. </p>
<ul>
<li>Only write the name of your product into “Name of Product/Title.” No brand, no adjectives like “awesome” or additional describing words. Just the product name.</li>
<li>Everything like “awesome” or additional describing words can be put into the “short description”. Don`t need to repeat the title here.</li>
<li>Images needs to have a decent resolution. Sometimes there are images uploaded in the size of a preview icon. That is resulting to too low quality on the screen and would be a reason for delisting your hunt.</li>
<li>Use only screenshots, videos, photos and text elements related to the product. Uploading an own footer could result in delisting, as long as it is not associated with the main product.</li>
<li>Illegal products, products using illegal content, crypto or fin scam products, a scam in general, pornography or products from “Notsafeatwork.” will get delisted.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Posting Guideline Nr.6</h3>
>**6. No Duplication Allowed**
>Steemhunt does not allow the same product to be posted twice. The website automatically checks the URL, but it is still your responsibility to check that the product has not been posted previously. If your product has already been featured from the same brand/maker, the duplication is allowed only when the product is a newer model (V2) or has been majorly updated from the original one.
[Source](https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#6-no-duplication-allowed)

<p>Before even starting a hunt, this would be the first step you should take as a hunter. Use the search function at Steemhunt and look for your hunt.</p>
<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmb8jbyH5AeUe58tUEin8BXSgNoXWnz5T23w7UUgUDSMPH/image.png)</center>

<p>To be sure check following parts in the search bar.</p>
<ul>
<li>product name</li>
<li>product brand</li>
<li>combination of name and brand</li>
<li>category</li>
<li>Unique selling proposition Keyword<br> ex) Drone: 4K Folding Drone =&gt; search 4K folding or folding drone</li>
<li>combine things together</li>
</ul>
<p>Our moderators are using the same search engine at Steemhunt do find duplicates. So with that method, you should be on the save side. </p>
<p>You might upload the same product if it got a significant update. For Apps, this would be a version change in the number (ex. Ver. 1.2 to 2.0) with real significant functional changes. For gadgets, this could be difficult, as they usually make a new product than using the same product name. (An exception could be Apple’s iPad?)</p>
<h3> Posting Guideline Nr.7</h3>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmay4UMDUyjMkxwdrtuMmhCJ7zyf99vMZNsrEnSxvuZfvz/image.png)
[Source: Glenn Carstens-Peters](https://unsplash.com/photos/0woyPEJQ7jc)
>**7. Games**
>There are countless games worldwide, and many of them have narrow target customers. If we accept all new games in Steemhunt, our ranking board may be dominated by games. So, **Steemhunt will ONLY accept games that have their own website**. Please note if you use any app store or game platform (e.g. Steam) URL on the game product link, your hunt will be delisted.
[Source](https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#7-games)

<p>The critical part here would be only that PG 7 overrules PG 3 (product link) and that Appstore links and Playstore links for Games would not be allowed anymore and delisted.</p>
<h3> Other parts</h3>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNvwHfyRrpkVTNhQnutFovDgDGLdMGJVC8FSEnso9Rant/image.png)[Source: Melanie Pongratz](https://unsplash.com/photos/SsBI9pweAeA)
>**Moderation**
>All hunts posted on Steemhunt.com are verified by Steemhunt moderators first. Once our moderators check that your hunt meets all the criteria in the posting guidelines, your hunt will be approved and considered for the ranking competition and @steemhunt's upvote based on your hunter level.
>
>Your post will be hidden by the moderators if it does not meet the posting guidelines, in which case your hunt will be delisted from the ranking board. Due to time constraints, posts may not be processed before the cutoff time. In this case, your post will automatically roll over to the next day's competition and will be verified that day. Also, the moderator may ask you to edit/change some of the content. If you don't respond within 24 hours, your post will be hidden permanently.
[Source](https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#moderation)

<p>As mentioned, our moderators check each part of the posting guideline and after that leave a comment that your hunt is either verified or not. In some cases, the moderator is giving the hunt another chance and ask for an edit and in that case, it is mentioned in the comment of your moderator. If the hunter does not respond within 24hours after the moderator’s comment request for an edit, the hunt will be delisted. This is mainly because we had a lot of hunts in a “non-edit black hole” for too long.</p>
<p>We get often the question from hunters “When is my hunt reviewed?”. As our moderators work as volunteers around the world within their available time, we have (as like other Steem projects) no SLA (Service Level Agreement) for reviewing a post. This means we work the queue line from old to new and depending on how many moderators are active that day it is going to be faster or slower. So the honest answer to your question when your hunt is going to be reviewed is when a moderator grabs your hunt from the queue line. :) But don`t worry too much, because when your hunt is not reviewed in the same KST (Korean standard time) window, it will be moved automatically to the next window.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Blacklist</strong><br>Steemhunt is running a blacklist to maintain a fair community platform. If you commit any of the following actions, you will be blacklisted.</p>
<ol>
<li>Leave comments multiple times with irrelevant content to receive Steemhunt’s upvotes.</li>
<li>Constantly plagiarise your content.<br>Even if you are blacklisted, you can still use our platform (posting, upvoting, and commenting), however, you won’t be able to get upvoted by Steemhunt for 30 days. If you receive “permanent blacklist” status, you are not eligible to receive Steemhunt’s upvotes indefinitely. We announce the blacklist via the #blacklist channel in our Discord Group.<br><a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#blacklist">Source</a></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>We are running a blacklist to keep spamming, milking under control. If we see or get a report about a hunter making meaningless comments for an upvote or effortless comments just for the upvote this hunter will be blacklisted. It has to be mentioned that a blacklist does not mean that the hunter’s activities are in any way compromised. The only difference is, that the hunter will not receive any upvotes from the Steemhunt Bot.</p>
<h2>2. Conclusion</h2>
Trimming the posting guideline is giving much more products the chance to be featured at Steemhunt and also reduce the objectivity of a hunt and the interference between moderators and hunters. In fact, the moderation speed has as an example for me almost doubled, as we don`t have to check too many aspects of a hunt like the age of a product, availability, launching date, etc.

<p>On the other side, the quality of hunts has been decreased over the last week, as we now allow more products to be verified. But for a long run, my personal feeling is that the Hunter level in combination that the pressure of getting a higher ranking is much lower than before, Hunter`s community will make the ranking organic and well curated.</p>
<p>By the way, tweaking on Hunter`s Level is still ongoing and it is nothing special when someone’s level is going up and down during the tweaking.</p>
