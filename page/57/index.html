        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Hi, @jayplayco back here with another article about @Steemhunt !</p>
<p>As a Steemian newbie it was really refreshing to see that there is a way to mine coins with writing good content at Steemit.</p>
<p>Especially for Newbies like me I`ve found a good service based on Steemit called @steemhunt and available at <a href="http://steemhunt.com">http://steemhunt.com</a>.</p>
<p>Long story short, <strong>Steemhunt is a steemit based producthunt. </strong><br>Read also : <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@jayplayco/what-is-steemhunt-and-why-should-i-care">Article about what Steemhunt is!</a></p>
<p>This time we are going to learn about the airdrop Steemhunt is currently planning, as this will be one of the biggest airdrops available at Steemit.</p>
<p><strong><h3>1. What is a Hunt Token?</h3></strong><br>Hunt Token is going to be a Smart Media Token (<a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@ned/announcing-smart-media-tokens-smts">SMT</a>) based Token, which means that it will be build based on the <a href="https://smt.steem.io/">Whitepaper</a> from Ned back in Sep 2017. It is going to be a decentralised token system to reward product influencers, buy kickstarted products and help makers and brands to reach out product influencers on the Steemhunt.com platform.</p>
<p>At Steemhunt the HUNT Tokens can be earned being actively writing product reviews and on the other side there is are separate categories where makers can earn HUNT Tokens kickstarting projects (Ideahunt) and also can spend HUNT Tokens to recruite product reviewer (Reviewhunt)</p>
<p>Steemhunt is going to issue 500M HUNT Tokens and 50% of them are going to be airdropped. Yes, you read it right, 50%, in total 250M HUNT Tokens are going to be distributed.</p>
<p><strong><h3>2. What does the HUNT Token distribution looks like?</h3></strong><br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbX1bEMiEr5nXnQ9cdVfajGR8k9zy3YExeUBxSLMV1Pcf/image.png" alt=""><br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmW7izfiQDcikYsaRuRrrRBPke77EPWcQudVwpt4JWzsSx/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong><h3>3. Give me HUNT Tokens! But how?</h3></strong></p>
<p>There are in total 5 different ways to gain HUNT Tokens from the Airdrop for FREE! (20% of the volume are going to be into the private sale sector, so will not count them here!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Get it if you <strong>have Steem Power</strong> (beg. July 2018)</li>
<li>Get it if you <strong>delegate Steem Power</strong> (available NOW)</li>
<li>Get it if you <strong>collect Referrals</strong> (end July 2018)</li>
<li>Get it if you <strong>Vote and resteem articles</strong> (beg. June 2018)</li>
<li>Get if if you <strong>Hunt products and review them</strong> (end July 2018)</li>
</ul>
<p>So let`s get into it step by step. Be informed that most of the Airdrop schedules are still not prepared and we are going to wait for announcements from Steemhunt.</p>
<h3>**a.Have Steem Power**</h3>
Easy one. Just have a look if you have any Steem Power. (If not, you can buy some or just start writing good content or even better start steemhunting!) You can find it under https://steemit.com/@YOURNAMEHERE/transfers. If you have delegated some of your Steem Power, don`t worry. Steemhunt will count the original available Steempower.
After that join Steemhunt.com at wait for their announcement. (Following @steemhunt will make it easier) Steemhunt is going to add a menu where you can APPLY for HUNT Tokens. It is very important that you ACTIVELY APPLY for HUNT Tokens at Steemhunt, so the best is to go to Steemhunt.com and just join the service for now. You need to have an active Steemit account. HUNT Tokens are going to be airdropped 1:1 to your Steem Power, based on "First Come First Serve", but Steemhunt has prepared about 100M, so there is a plenty of HUNT Tokens for almost everybody.

<p><strong>How much do I get?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>exactly the same amount of your Steem Power you own is going to be airdropped.</li>
</ul>
<h3>**b.Delegate Steem Power**</h3>
This is the only Airdrop you can already join right now.  For that you have to delegate your Steem Power to @steemhunt. 

<p><a href="https://steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&delegatee=steemhunt&vesting_shares=100%20SP">100 SP</a> | <a href="https://steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&delegatee=steemhunt&vesting_shares=500%20SP">500 SP</a> | <a href="https://steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&delegatee=steemhunt&vesting_shares=1000%20SP">1000 SP</a> </p>
<p>Or just manually change the URL inputting the wanted amount below. Change the “vesting_shares=1000” to “vesting_shares=WANTEDAMOUNT”.<br><a href="https://steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&amp;delegatee=steemhunt&amp;vesting_shares=1000%20SP">https://steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&amp;delegatee=steemhunt&amp;vesting_shares=1000%20SP</a></p>
<p><strong>How much do I get?</strong><br>This is difficult to say. Steemhunt has reserved a daily amount of 90K for all delegated Steem Power (They have actually have over 330K Steempower in this moment) You will get a daily amount of HUNT Tokens based on your Ratio you have delegated. On the last report this was about 190 HUNT Tokens for 100SP delegated. My guess is this will drop quite fast, as more people will join the Steemhunt community and are going to delegate SP to them. But the sooner the better, as the drops are planned for about 500 days, until the SMT will be ready. (Don`t think it will take that long, as Ned has announced it already for 2018)</p>
<h3>**c.Collect Referrals**</h3>
An often seen marketing method to engage users and give them benefits. The referral system is still under development. In total 90K Tokens are reserved per day and will be distributed to people who refer Steemhunt to others. So sign up for steemhunt.com, wait until the development for the referral system is done and get your referral link and spread the goods news! Max cap is 5000 per Person. 

<p><strong>How much do I get?</strong><br>Important here is to be fast, as the days past on more and more people will have referrals and the total assigned tokens of 90K pcs. will shrink per day. Calculation is based on 90,000 Tokens assigned by 1/n (referrals)<br>If there are 90,000 referrals collected, you will get 1 HUNT Token per day.</p>
<h3>**d.Vote and resteem**</h3>
In total 60K Tokens per day will be distributed for Steemhunters who are upvoting or resteeming hunters posts located under the **"TODAY"** tap. Important is, only the TODAY Tab will be counted. 40K are for upvoters and 20K for resteemers. Airdrop starts when the wallet interface is ready.

<p><strong>How much do I get?</strong><br>If at that day 2000 people are resteeming hunters post, you will get 10 HUNT tokens. If 2000 people are upvoting hunters posts from the Today tab, you will get 20 HUNT tokens and so on. Important is also that these activities have to be done AT steemhunt.com and not steemit.com.</p>
<h3>**e.Hunt products and review them**</h3>

<p>If you have been succesfully upvoted from @steemhunt you will be 60,000TOKENS/n of the daily airdrop. In total steemhunt upvotes the post itself, a review comment (pros and cons comments) and moderator comments. Additionally the voting power from steemhunt is also important how much of the distributed Tokens you will get.</p>
<p><strong>How much do I get?</strong><br>This is going to be really difficult to give an exact amount, as it depends on the voting power of steemhunt (which also depends on how your post is ranked, etc.). At the current moment the daily total VP pool is about 1080%, so if you get a voting with 20% this will be about 880 HUNT TOKENS. So this means writing good steemhunter contents is essential!</p>
<p><strong><h3>4. Conclusion</h3></strong></p>
<p>HUNT Tokens are going to create an own economy based on the Steemit.com community. All kind of rewards are going to be paid later on as HUNT Tokens and seeing producthunt.com growing even under that kind of circumstances (not reawarding the actual hunters), I strongly believe that Steemhunt can replace this, as soon as enough people are getting used to this kind of system. As there is no max supply for HUNT, there WILL be an inflation which has been vital as example also for the Steem community.</p>
<p>Be informed that the SMT from steemit is also still under development and that therefore the steemhunt team has decided to start as Ethereum ERC20 Token and then swap them afterwords when the SMT network is ready.</p>

<h2 id="Hunter’s-comment"><a href="#Hunter’s-comment" class="headerlink" title="Hunter’s comment"></a>Hunter’s comment</h2><p>If you are using a laptop, tablet or even a bigger smartphone, sometimes you need to write longer text on this products. A laptop should be not a problem, but as soon as we start to type longer text on touch screens my productivity is going down quite fast.</p>
<p>Bluetooth keyboards are normaly very bulky, so I don`t carry them around but this Rolly Keyboard from LG can be rolled and it means that the product is really small and easy to carry around.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmT7a4TsJjKmNuRKbowejXiE9p6KhNcbGamrWZUKDByrds/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Based on Bluetooth HD profie and a rolled out dimension of 10.78”x1.24”x1.20” it runs up to 3.5 month with one AAA battery.</p>
<p>The first version of this product was quite expensive for a bluetooth keyboard and the official retail price is 100USD, but you can get it now also on amazon for about 45USD, which is OK.<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSXanSntrbwW2puFR4oU3HTA4VXcpmoqnYZfHRmM8LRSa/image.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="Hunter’s-comment"><a href="#Hunter’s-comment" class="headerlink" title="Hunter’s comment"></a>Hunter’s comment</h2><p>Ezpz has been introduced 2014 and started at that time with a successful Kickstarter.</p>
<p>The main idea behind it is to combine the placemat with the bowl. Due to the suction the bowl is not anymore removeable for children and so mom and dad can give the food without having any concerns.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that this product is out of pure high quality food grade silicone, you can dishwash it, get in into the oven or even boil it in water for disinfection if needed.</p>

            <html>
<p>Hi this is @jayplayco and today I would like to write about a relatively new service called @steemhunt&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am personally using Steemhunt since a few days but as a newbie the system itself is interesting, as it rewards the content directly without using any bot, which has to be paid directly. (Yes, I learned also that a lot of bots are available to push your content, but that should be something what I would like to write about later)</p>
<h3><strong>1. What is Steemhunt?</strong></h3>
<p>Steemhunt started about 5month ago as a competitor to producthunt (https://www.producthunt.com/). Producthunt started similar as steemhunt as a platform to encourage the users to find services and products which are mentionable. But now this platform has been transferred to a place where the "makers" can advertise their products.<br>
<br>
<em><strong>Elevator pitch : Steemhunt is a steemit based producthunt.</strong></em></p>
<p>The main idea behind it is to give the revenue stream back to the hunters who are actually looking for great products to introduce using the steemit economy. You can already use this service under http://steemhunt.com<br>
<br>
The enthusiastic team behind this project are @tabris (for development) and @project7 (for design). It seems that they are working day and night to make this project successful. Especially due to the great mix of development and design the page steemhunt.com looks very elegant and the userinterface is very easy to use. Additionally each single post from steemhunt is also well curated and designed, so you can get the information very fast and the graphics are making it easy to understand.</p>
<p>The project is still heavily under development and the final stage could take more than another year, but the Steemhunt function itself is already live for the last 2 month.<br>
https://steemit.com/steemdev/@steemhunt/steemhunt-for-all-product-enthusiasts-on-steemit</p>
<p>Steemhunt is planning to have in total 3 different catagories, which are Steemhunt, Reviewhunt and Ideahunt.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmYpmd8mG6uAeFCLtuZ3WxpYZsGDddPgA2KHxGN2f28zFQ/token-flow.jpg" width="2016" height="1700"/></p>
<p>&nbsp;a. Steemhunt : Hunters can upload new products and get rewarded with HUNT tokens (this Hunt Tokens are going to be Smart Media Tokens, also called SMT's). The reward is going to be on a daily competition.</p>
<p>b. Reviewhunt : So called makers (or companies) can call a bounty to activate hunters and ask them to write product reviews or app reviews, etc. The companies will have to reward them in HUNT tokens.</p>
<p>c. Ideahunt : A mini crowdfunding site payable in HUNT Tokens. As soon as the HUNT Tokens get established people could buy new products or service with Ideahunt. This would be a steemit base "kickstarter" or "Indieogogo"</p>
<h3><strong>2. What can we do now?</strong></h3>
<p>As the platform Steemhunt is going to be a merger of 3 services (steemhunt, reviewhunt and ideahunt) you can currently use only the function steemhunt at the site. For this you are going to have a Steemit account and use this account to login on http://steemhunt.com . After that you are able to post a new product.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As soon as you successfully uploaded a product it will be listed in the "Today" tab. Please be sure to upload within the posting guidelines. Otherwise your product review will be denied. Steemhunt has a very well functioning team with so called Moderators, so EVERY single post will get a review and will be accepted or denied. If it gets denied, they will leave you a reply why.<br>
<br>
Important rules for writing a product review are like below.</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;a. Only products, no business (No Apple or Microsoft)</blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;b. Unique IT hardware or services</blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;c. Only ENGLISH</blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;d. Product Link has to be valid website with the availability to BUY the product.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;e. No Plagiarism - no copy and paste from the site itself. Steemhunt is checking this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;f. Only New and Cool products.</blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;g. Unique product description in your OWN words.</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>In short, Steemhunt is checking if the products are really unique and innovative and if the description is also unique.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdTSutcEyZTaVjQHbsHeD3qDHBgYQbs7XroxwwwRNMG7H/image.png" width="1380" height="898"/></p>
<h3><strong>3. What happens after posting?</strong></h3>
<p>Your post is going to compete with other posts for the day (Ends 00:00 KST Time) After that @Steemhunt is going to upvote each single post based on the popularity (upvotes). Additionally Steemhunt is also upvoting comments with so called "Pros and Cons". At the current day I have got about 0.60USD for one post and most of the amount has been coming from Steemhunt. Additionally I have got 0.28USD for a comment to my own article.</p>
<blockquote><br>
<img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcCqfWSVtsm5Czn2LjztN7o3XFdC98hdZkyeDK9duXSNx/image.png" width="836" height="421"/></blockquote>
<p>You can find these on most Steemhunt posts as example. Below you can see that Steemhunt has voted for the comment with Pros and Cons.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>I am sure that you will have fun while steemhunting, so don`t wait and write your first steemhunt post!<br>

<h2 id="Hunter’s-comment"><a href="#Hunter’s-comment" class="headerlink" title="Hunter’s comment"></a>Hunter’s comment</h2><p>Using polymer compound silicone this material grips everything flat on the surface. Ideal for using it in the car and stick your phone, cards or keys on it.</p>
<p>The stickiness can be recovered when flushing it in clean water.</p>
<p>For a price of 6.99 UK Pounds it looks like a bit pricy gadget, but if you are not using high quality silicone on this kind of product, I have seen melting grip strips in the car.</p>
<p>Guess for this price this grip strip will be alright.</p>

<h2 id="Hunter’s-comment"><a href="#Hunter’s-comment" class="headerlink" title="Hunter’s comment"></a>Hunter’s comment</h2><p>Being on travel is (almost) always fun but I guess everybody remembers the time when standing at the luggage carousel and realizing that almost every luggage is either black or silver.</p>
<p>This product is here to get you out of this kind of situation, as it is a luggage cover with your own face (or from someone else) printed on it. So nobody will be able to snug your luggage and claim it is theirs~.</p>
<p>The head cases are made from polyester spandex so they stretch over the bag. </p>
<p>All you need is a high quality photo from your (or from someone else) to be uploaded on the site.</p>
