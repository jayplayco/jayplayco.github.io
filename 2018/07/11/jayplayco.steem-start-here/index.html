<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.<br>This time I would like to give an insight for all people who stumbled over Steemhunt and have a new start in this community.</p>
<p>To all readers who are new to <a href="https://steemhunt.com/">Steemhunt</a>, Steemhunt is a recently launched service build on Steem to enable Hunters to hunt new and cool products and get rewarded based on their rankings on a daily base.  If you are new to Steemhunt, you should try first this post. <a href="https://steemit.com/steemdev/@steemhunt/introducing-steemhunt-daily-ranking-of-effortlessly-cool-products-fueled-by-steem-blockchain">LINK</a></p>
<p>The first time is always tricky when starting in a new community. There are still members who know more than me, and the tough thing is to define “what I could ask and what I should ask.” I can have total newbie questions but still don`t know where to get all the information needed, so this is somehow a guide to navigate a new user through this information gap.</p>

<h2> 1. Steemhunt, Where should I start?</h2>

<p><img src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmewH6TTm3hauhxGeGBk8GnK2bwA2KVJ8hPE71LA1yi3Dh" alt="image.png"> <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/qDY9ahp0Mto">Source: Ben White</a><br>Ok, if you just stumbled over Steemhunt and would like to start to hunt a product but have no idea what you should take care of, here is a step by step guide into the Steemhunt community.</p>
<h4>a. The Community.</h4>
Steemhunt is a community where hunters, the team, guardians, influencers, and moderators are communicating with each other to help, make the community better and also to tune Steemhunt. An interesting fact for hunters outside from Steem is that only a part of the communication is happening on the Steemhunt platform itself and the vibrant and real-time communication is happening on a platform called Discord.

<p>Discord is a text and voice chat program which allows bigger groups to communicate easily together. You can use it as a web app or use the native app for Windows or Mac or Linux. There are also mobile apps available, which makes it easier to respond on the go.<br><a href="https://discordapp.com/download">Source: Discord App</a> To find the Steemhunt discord channel you need to have an invite link, as there is no real search function for chat groups at Discord. The Invite Link for discord can be found <a href="https://discord.gg/mWXpgks">here: https://discord.gg/mWXpgks </a> and also at the footer from all my posts about Steemhunt.</p>
<h4>b. Steem posts</h4>
There are a lot of guides and good introduction texts about Steemhunt in different languages. Just search for Steemhunt on Steem you will get dozens of a different article. Some selected articles are also in this footer.

<h2> 2. I`ve logged in!</h2>

Ok, now we have logged in at Steemhunt, and we could start with the motto “learning by doing!”, But after moderating some hunts from new hunters, it is still recommended to read some [guidelines](https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md) before just starting, as a delisted hunt can be quite frustrating. But even before that, we will have to decide if we are going to be a hunter for products or a hunter as a curator or maybe both.
<h4>a.Hunting for products.</h4>
Steemhunt is developing its system fast to keep abuse out of the system. It is not perfect in the moment, and there will be no system free of abusing attempts, but Steemhunt is evolving fast to keep the main purpose of this platform. Hunt cool and new products and get rewarded based on the daily ranking! Currently, there are partly more than 200 hunts submitted daily, but the huntable number of products will get smaller and smaller. In the end, you will have to be an enthusiastic hunter to find great products which other hunters like to upvote so that you can get a meaningful ranking for the day.
*Output*: verified hunts are getting an upvote from the Steemhunt bot. Later verified hunts would also get Hunt Tokens airdropped until SMT is ready.
<h4>b.Curating Hunts</h4>
You can also upvote other hunts you like or think should have a better ranking. Or you can write meaningful Pro/Con reviews and discuss with other hunters about the product.
*Output*: Upvotes are getting Hunt Tokens airdropped until SMT is ready. Meaningful Pro/Con reviews are getting randomly upvoted until 100 comments per day.

<h2>3. Now I want to do something~!</h2>
If you have now read the [posting guideline](https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md) and decided if you are going to be a curator and upvote or look for great products and hunt we can get into the details.


<h4>a. Steemhunt Curator</h4>
Make sure that you log in to Steemhunt. Upvotes outside of Steemhunt (ex. Steemit, Busy, etc.) are not counted on the ranking and also not counted for the Hunt Airdrop.  Based on your reputation on Steem and if it is the first time you logged in your Steemhunt Voting weight will vary. The voting weight is constantly adapted to the reality we face with different abuse trials, but the general rule is as below.
* Reputation below 34 will have no voting weight at Steemhunt
* Reputation from 35-44 => x0.5 voting weight
* Reputation from 45-54 => x1.0 voting weight
* Reputation from 55-59 => x2.0 voting weight
* Reputation from 60~    => x3.0 voting weight

<p>Additionally, to your voting weight, the Diversity Score(DS) is multiplied. You can find additional information about the DS <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@steemhunt/steemhunt-s-account-based-voting-ver-2-diversity-score">here</a>, but in short, it is giving you a bonus or disadvantage if the system detects a specific behavior. Good behavior is when you use a minimum amount of voting weight and upvote a different kind of users and don`t circle vote. The DS is calculated at the moment based of 30 days, so a fast enhancing of your Steemhunt voting weight is not possible, but if we keep constantly upvoting good products at Steemhunt, it will get higher.</p>
<center>**Example**</center>
<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZpxC3LdBgUknQ9MRrQos4bdTw4aAwCQGSA9sLAGmftPK/image.png)</center>
My reputation at Steem is currently 59, and my voting weight should be 2.0. Due to the Diversity Score multiplied I have a voting weight of 1.77 finally. If you have a great diversity score, it can be even multiplied higher than x1.0, so there are voters with a voting weight higher than 3.0.


<h4>b. Steemhunt Product Hunter</h4>
As product hunter your life is going to be exciting and in the beginning not so easy. I will give you a concise introduction, but if you are keen to be a great hunter I can recommend the article of one of our guardians @fnkmayhem -[How to craft a good hunt](https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@fknmayhem/understanding-steemhunt-and-how-to-craft-a-good-hunt)

<ul>
<li>Use the search function within Steemhunt to make sure that your hunt has not been hunted already. (Use the brand name, the model name, keywords to be sure)</li>
<li>Recheck if the product fits into the product category. <blockquote>
<p>Web services, Mobile apps, API, IT solutions, bots, open sources or other types of software, Tech gadgets, hardware, IoT/connected/wearable devices, Games, Innovative Engineering/Design Products <a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#2-types-of-products-to-post">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>If it is a game, make sure that it is not too old. (best case launched within the last three month)<a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#8-quality-of-the-post">Guideline 11</a></li>
<li>If it is an App, make sure that it is not too generic. <a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#12-mobileweb-extention-apps">Guideline 12</a>)</li>
<li>If you are posting an app or game, make sure that you use the brand page if it is available both on iOS and Android. Product link. Use only brand pages, as e-commerce is not allowed anymore.<a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#12-mobileweb-extention-apps">Guideline 3</a></li>
<li>The title should include only the name of the product</li>
<li>The short description can be used to give further information.</li>
<li>Use high-res screenshots explaining the product well.</li>
<li>Write a short hunters comment in your own words. Don`t copy and paste! It is one of the most reasons a hunt get de-listed. If you are using quotes, use the correct marks and cite the source. An example below.<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeLigzTkLyZx5L3TW3q2H14FNTESQkYJREBhyubtWcRzL/image.png" alt=""><br>This is how it would look like in the editor within Steemhunt. You can see that I have used the “&gt;” quotation mark and cited the source at the end,<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTps8338AUqA8YxwRmJWBQHYwwf7n3KJ3qPjGDp9YWtwV/image.png" alt=""><br>And that would be the result in the final hunter’s comment.<a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md#5-plagiarism-and-copyrights">Guideline 5</a></li>
<li>Recheck your hunt and press “POST NOW.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, the easiest way to make a great hunt is to find a genuinely new, unique and cool product. And yes, that is not easy and the reason why it is called hunting :).</p>
<h2> 4. Find help</h2>
When a post got delisted, or I am not 100% sure about something after reading the posting guidelines or want to hang out with other hunters, then the Steemhunt [Steemhunts Discord](https://discord.gg/mWXpgks) is the right place for you.
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZShuMW1nAxjHBc6pqSgiASv92f2U2DAFYZCnPhycx64R/image.png)

<p>When you first join the server, you will start at “Start here.” If you are new to Discord, you will find on the right upper side a white pin. This is the place you have to press if you want to see all pinned important messages. These pinned messages are different for each channel.</p>
<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXEyfVJiGQq3abzk5fj4kP8s9rJd1k2kxQc1iRJMGQpCA/image.png)</center>

<p>As a newbie, the following channels are interesting for you.</p>
<h4>a.#faq</h4>
Here all important questions are gathered and also official articles from steemhunt are here.
<h4>b.#announcement</h4>
All important announcements from the team directly are gathered here. If you scroll up, you can follow the history of the development of the steemhunt platform.
<h4>c.#question</h4>
If you have any questions, drop it here. The community is well working, and normally a community member will help you out.
<h4>d.#mod-xxxxx</h4>
If your post has a moderator comment for edit, or it has been delisted, and you want to appeal, you will have to find the correct moderator channel for that. Post your Steemhunt (and not steemit) link into that channel and your text what you want to appeal. (As an example, “edited as requested”)

<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
This time this post has been written from the perspective of a new hunter joining Steemhunt. I hope I was able to get your interest in Steemhunt and I would be pleased if you would now be ready to be a Steemhunter!
