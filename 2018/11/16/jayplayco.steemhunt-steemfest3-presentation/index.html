            <p>Hi, @jayplayco here.</p>
<p>It is now been a week that @steemfest has been held in Poland. I hope that a lot of followers of Steemhunt have been watching the presentation from @project7 at Steemfest.</p>
<p>You can find detailed information about the video <a href="https://steemit.com/blockchain/@creativecrypto/steemhuntasteemfueledproducthuntsteemfest30presentations-3lj8zxf21g">here</a></p>
<p>For all those who are not able to see it or have it easier to read than listen to it or don’t have the time I have made a transcript from the presentation. The text has been slightly modified from the original presentation, so it is easier to read and understand. </p>
<p>Most important information from this presentation are two points.</p>
<ul>
<li>possible listing of Hunt tokens on <a href="https://daybit.com/">DAYBIT</a></li>
<li>NFT for Ideahunt</li>
</ul>
<p>I am planning to handle this issues on a separate article.</p>
<p>Direct Link to the Video : <a href="https://youtu.be/lgb8sRx6uVs?t=7627">https://youtu.be/lgb8sRx6uVs?t=7627</a>(play to 1:24:30 for the Steeemhunt presentation)</p>

<p>Hello, everyone, my name is Young Hwi, but my Steemit name is @project7, so probably it’s much easier for you guys to call me project7. I’m a designer and co-founder of Steemhunt.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXXi6wJqXBNs2KJxgn1NZi84DgKm3L4GBgs6HaZZtD4vs/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I hope that many of you here already know what Steemhunt is but for those who don’t know much about it I like to give a very brief introduction about what Steemhunt is. So basically, Steemhunt is a community with a bunch of geeky techy people, who share some cool new innovative tech products and then compete with others like, “hey who did share the cooler and newer stuff than others” and later on a daily basis there’s a ranking chart created and curated by all the techy people. This has been a very successful community so far because of all the support from Steemians. Thank you very very much for all that support!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaDh2XnDw7znCmEnvJNtnawNRWWNxUN9SJF7FMtoXkG8Z/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p> I want to show that the most important part of Steemhunt’s value is that we don’t want to create just a good community. There are already a lot of great communities in Steemit. But we want to utilize those community forces to be an asset.  You guys are great users in that community, but probably someone else wants to use that as an asset.</p>
<p>Lots of platforms just utilized it for advertisement or display ads. This is also good, but it can be much better.  So that’s why we invented the Hunt token economy, that promotes both sites, hunters, and makers. Who wants to utilize hunters force as an asset, hunts token will be rewarded to those hunters activities, so hunters keep sharing cool new innovative stuff constantly.  That will promote more traffic outside of the Steemit community and will also attract all the makers and companies.  If a maker wants to utilize the forces from hunters to boost up marketing, then they’re going to invite more and more users into the Hunt platform. That’s going to reward hunters what will increase more hunters actions.  That results in more traffic and more makers. So this is our growth vehicle, and that will make us different from all the others. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmV7HvUvaCrpcDDPzFj8qbCFP2EV12sFzckBi3vFHjavgm/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That’s why we’re creating the Hunt platform. We’re not going just to staying as a Steemhunt community, but we’re creating Ideahunt and Reviewhunt on top of the Steemhunt community.  We are already working on Reviewhunt, and the target launch will be April next year. Hunters always dig out new stuff, and they have a lot of knowledge about tech products.  Some makers want to utilize their force to boost up their new product launching. They can suggest a large discount deal for hunters or they can give Hunt (token) rewards to them. Hunters will then check the products, and they’re going to create very high-quality reviews for them. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTrW2uNq7AbDTLmrNFnhjKe64LmbSWrRVqpLCkY3ciz74/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The biggest benefit for the makers to utilize our platform is that they can involve all the hunters as users.  Anyone who was involved in an early startup knows how painful it is to get high-quality users in the very initial stage. This is going to be a very strong platform for those innovative makers who want access to that kind of high-quality content.</p>
<p>Idea hunt is the last milestone in our roadmap. But we strongly believe that this is going to be a game changer as a crowdfunding platform. Ideahunt is a crowdfunding platform on top of the Steemhunt community. We’ve noticed that current crowdfunding platforms have a major issue, especially Kickstarter. An example, if you backed a project and you need to pay right away.  Then you wait until the product is shipped or not. You forget about that. We don’t think that this is efficient.  If you back a project then you have to increase the value of the product even before they launched. At this moment we can’t disclose all the details but we are going to introduce it very soon. <strong>One point is that we are going to utilize Non-fungible token (NFT) transactions for Ideahunt.</strong> With NFT an increase of the backer’s actions can increase the value of the new product launch. This is going to be a real game changer in this industry.</p>

<p>Our ambitious plan requires to have lots of strong users. That’s why we initiated a quite unique way of distributing our Hunt token. By distributing 50% of airdrops. The core idea of this plan is that we want to connect token holders to be the users.  Lots of ICO’s are based on the fact that token holders are just investors. They’re not likely to be connected to be a user. That’s not what we wanted to do.  So that’s why we have a very unique token distribution.  Still, around 24% is distributed, so there is plenty of chance to join this airdrop. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZeSKVYt1WW7wHdeAiCHjkPwQtCyj7R3c7dnCDdogWxdW/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We also started a witness node a month ago with an ambitious mission as a witness.  We want to make the Steem Blockchain a place that is favorable for Dapps and SMT’s. Then we can invite a lot of companies to be there. So please support us here. When we approach the market for HUNT tokens, we also want to approach the SMT wide protocol.  Final goal would be that SMT tokens can be listed together.  This is our aim.</p>

<p>We have some interesting news today as we are discussing with DAYBIT, which is a recently launched exchange market, but already almost in the top 15 level, globally.  We are discussing to list Hunt token probably at the end of this year or beginning of the next year. Still ongoing communication so we can’t confirm yet, but we’re going to give you very exciting news very soon. Thank you so much</p>
