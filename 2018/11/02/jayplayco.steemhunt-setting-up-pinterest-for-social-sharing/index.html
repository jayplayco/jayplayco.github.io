<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.<br>There are different ways to earn Hunt Coins, but one of the most effective ones is spreading the news about Steemhunt outside of Steem. I would like to show an effective method without having already a ton of followers on platforms but still be able to generate traffic and earn Hunt Coins.</p>
<h2> 0. Repository </h2>
https://github.com/Steemhunt/web

<h2>1. What is the Social Airdrop?</h2>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmd53JRukBwt5KbCr6C8FzRF3uJKVswcHie45cWdiMRggq/image.png)
Source : https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@steemhunt/share-cool-hunts-on-your-social-channels-and-get-hunt-tokens-everyday-or-sponsor-report-20

<p>Steemhunt started about two months ago an airdrop which is concentrating on social media platforms driving traffic to Steemhunt from outside the Steem economy. The core of this share is to share cool Hunts hunted by hunters and spread them to your followers like Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>
<h2>2. Finding the right spot</h2>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUPgEhH2USFB7CwzkmZnqWA8Wbj3bUDes38hs6f5nMgh6/image.png)

<p>A difficulty is, if you don`t really have a large follower base established on different platforms. Otherwise just sharing a link into any forum, platform, etc. is actually spamming it and not welcomed at that platform.</p>
<p>If you are good at it, you could also try to create a new facebook group concentrating on gadgets and cool stuff and use the Steemhunt links for that group. This will have definitely a larger effect on a long way but I found an effective way without disturbing the platform itself but using the mechanism of it. It is Pinterest.</p>
<h2>3. How I did it</h2>

<p>I’ve created a separate account which has the same name as my Steem name and created different boards with themes that could relate to products hunted on Steemhunt. I came up with special watches, drones, E-bikes, Innovative houses, etc. You could expand these boards with more categories from Steemhunt. Each board includes about 20-25 hunts from Steemhunt.</p>
<p>An important part creating this boards was to keep an eye on the thumbnail from the hunt, as Pinterest is a very visual platform.</p>
<p>As you can see this account is quite new and I have actually no followers at all, but I still get from time to time some traffic send to Steemhunt from these few boards. So how does it come that I could create traffic without even having any followers? It is because of the mechanism of Pinterest. If a user of Pinterest finds a so-called “Pin” good, they can pin it also in one of their boards. And if that user has followers, they would see this new pin in their stream. In that way, I can leverage my posting with the follower power of another user.</p>

<p>If you would be a better curator on Pinterest than me, this effect could very fast double and triple, as you could get also your own followers.</p>
<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWFKfZUwTe5znKaJRjHwoMLWEf1oRAsR1FFHYPSqR9WMD/image.png)</center>

<p>I don’t get social share rewards on a daily basis, more once a week or so but due to the fact that the boards will still exist when I don`t touch them, it is a good source of traffic. Of course, the boards would have more success when I will start to increase the numbers of boards, categories, and frequency of update.</p>
<p>Finding interesting board themes can be achieved also with the tools you have at Steemhunt. Click on one of the tags and you will find how many products they are, the ranking and also related tags. Based on that you can recheck on Pinterest if that could be of interest for users there.</p>

<h2>4. Social Airdrop is Hunters Level related</h2>

<p>A few days ago Steemhunt decided to apply hunter level-based weights on the effective counts from the traffic lead by social shares. The main reason is that there have been abusing (as always) accounts milking the airdrop. This means it is definitely an advantage when you are an active Hunter on Steemhunt.</p>

<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you are active you can earn Hunt tokens on many different ways and Social Airdrop is one of the methods to create organic traffic not only to Steemhunt but also to the Steem Blockchain. Good luck for your next hunt and happy pinning~!</p>
