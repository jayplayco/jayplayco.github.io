            <p>Hi, @jayplayco here!</p>
<p>After seeing the video curations fom @teamhumble, I thought it would be also great to have different views or different themes of curations. This time I am featuring mainly the hunts from @urbangladiator who has a hand to find all the Crypto collectibles out there. But also @chronocrypto, @producthunter, @vmirag, @mindblast and @heap has hunted some Cryto collectibles.</p>
<h3> What are Crypto Collectables? </h3>
[Crypto Kitties were just the beginning-outside link](https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-kitties-were-just-the-beginning/)
[A simple explanation of Crypto Collectibles-outside link](https://medium.com/crypto-simplified/a-simple-explanation-of-crypto-collectibles-8674c4527bd1)

<p>Crypto Collectables are digital goods based on Cryptocurrencies, mostly as Token based on Ethereum. You can normally buy them and after that breed, or fight or add accessories, etc, which depends on the concept of each Crypto collectables. In normal cases each collectable has some feature (or tag) to make it either normal or special and the price is varying based on this kind of sets. Additionally all digital goods are unique, so you will find never the same digital goods in the specific crypto collectables eco system.</p>
<p>So long story short, people buy crypto collectables, try to breed or fight with them to get more and looking for ones where the value of the collectable could increase.  Or they just buy it because they love it :)</p>
<h3> Hunting list ordered in Earnings </h3>

<li><p><strong><a href="https://steemhunt.com/@chronocrypto/steem-monsters-trade-battle-all-on-the-steem-blockchain">STEEM MONSTERS</a></strong><br>Trade, Battle, All on the Steem Blockchain!<br>@chronocrypto·181 votes and 22 comments<br>$103.18<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmU6748AezbTD9ZNXjW6bV6KooXWtvMjWQMVRGAQqVq2WX/image.png" alt=""><br>[EDIT] I was looking for the keyword collectible and Steem Monsters was not in there. After having a talk with @neddykelly I realized that I missed Steem Monsters! Tradeable, collectible cards with cool looking monsters and battles. The best part is that it is based on Steem so you can get upvotes for battles, etc. Even better, the prizes are within the Steem economy<del>! Yeah</del><br>They are currently in Alpha mode and selling the essential card pack for 5USD. Additional booster packs are also available. The account @steemmonsters will use part of the STEEM and SBD to make large upvotes for tournaments prizes. Will dive into this as soon as I am able to get my hands on cards.</p>

<li><p><strong><a href="https://steemhunt.com/@urbangladiator/0xuniverse-collect-planets-and-spaceships-on-the-eth-blockchain">0xUniverse</a></strong><br>Collect Planets and Spaceships on the ETH blockchain<br>@urbangladiator·35 votes and 1 comments<br>$8.69<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUdxUMtMTk3g7bduXmLDso9Xz49kXVWgvBcoMWyGn7rCP/image.png" alt=""><br>A Ethereum block based Cryptocollectible game to explorer the planets with your spaceship. Collecting Planets and spaceships sounds great, but if seems that the team is sitting in Russia and the government there is blocking the servers. I was able to connect to the Beta Test and it looked quite futuristic and clean. Let`s see how this evolves. The @steemhunt community liked it with 35  votes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://steemhunt.com/@urbangladiator/axie-infinity-collect-and-raise-axie-s-on-the-ethereum-blockchain">Axie Infinity</a></strong><br>Collect and raise Axie’s on the Ethereum blockchain<br>@urbangladiator·53 votes and 1 comments<br>$7.32<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQfj3uDgMEDYk16oZftWcF9k3Snaaf7SK6ygHqYi7tveo/image.png" alt=""><br>Also Etheureum based and you raise them from egg status into so called Axie`s, which are kind of monsters or creatures. Buying, selling, trading and also battling is possible. With battle you can improve skills or sizes or moves. For that you need to form a team of 3 Axies. They can also be feeded, cleaned and can sleep.<br>The roadmap is already gone quite far and a marketplace is already opened, presale ended and breeding and battle system opened. A raising feature is also planned.<br>The style of the characters are more in the “cute” direction and anime style.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://steemhunt.com/@urbangladiator/fishbank-collect-grow-and-trade-crypto-fish-tokens-in-the-new-blockc">FishBank</a></strong><br>Collect, grow and trade crypto fish tokens in the new blockc<br>@urbangladiator·16 votes and 1 comments<br>$4.54<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNQpejJVoc5KWJwLpuNGMv9rLsXWFzg3C4GPEtrQCjKhk/image.png" alt=""><br>@urbangladiator was not really exited about this one, but let`s dive into detail to see why.<br>Fishbank is based on ERC-721 and players can collect, fight and grow different fish tokens. It can be played with Metamask on Chrome or on iOS or Android with Trust Wallet or Toshi digital.<br>Fish prices are going from 0.05ETH for a common and up to 55ETH for a rare fish. The design of the fish itself is very dark toned in color and it is a little depressing looking at them. It seems that the designer behind this project prefer darker color tones. The look of the collectibles is also ‘not my style’ to explain it softly and to be honest it looks ugly. Sorry about that but my opinion.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://steemhunt.com/@urbangladiator/pixo-arena-fighting-collectible-game-powered-by-ethereum">Pixo Arena</a></strong><br>Fighting Collectible game powered by Ethereum<br>@urbangladiator·60 votes and 7 comments<br>$4.21<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZvxf5shc9Kkw361xHTvonQCGv5kXRxTco87wcmF5Rj6B/image.png" alt=""><br>To be honest it is not 100% fair to give Pixo Arena the 4th place, as the hunt for ranking is still running for this one. (more than 8 hours from writing) but still it gives a good look into what it could be. Pixo Arena shows their collectibles in a 8Bit Design look and if you like this kind of retro style you will love it. Main goal here is to collect so called Pixos, which are not breedable and don`t inherit characteristics from other Pixos. There is a Battle arena where the Pixos can fight and get prized in crytocurrency. Also they are able to equip artifacts. </p>

The design is great and if all digital goods will be at that level, than it could be really fun to collect them. They are in the current state showing one creature after the other and there are not much information available, but seeing the level of artwork this could be a good one. :)</p>

<li><p><strong><a href="https://steemhunt.com/@urbangladiator/cryptozombies-build-your-own-crypto-collectibles-game">CryptoZombies</a></strong><br>Build your own crypto-collectibles game<br>@urbangladiator·16 votes and 4 comments<br>$2.83<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRDd9GfM9yAmU9PFjV53Bik7MSwQwMepPH6WxjYskKGJc/image.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This time we have zombies. The difference is that it is an additive to a coding lesson for Solidity(Ethereum use s this code language) As lesson you are going to build a Zombie Army with a random DNA. By ending a coding lesson you get rewarded with crypto collectible Zombies. The best part is that it is a free platform and it seems to encourage people to get into Solidity.</p>
<p>7.<strong><a href="https://steemhunt.com/@heap/cryptokitties-breed-and-collect-adorable-creatures-using-ethereum">CryptoKitties</a></strong><br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWdDy9XegmAWxUReUfK3hqXouf2KHxW2y4c9z8RVrYwpD/image.png" alt=""><br>Breed and collect adorable creatures using Ethereum<br>@heap·5 votes and 2 comments<br>$2.24<br>Best well known Crypto collectibles. Breedable, collectable, some say adorable… Anyhow, these kitties were the start for the public hear about this kind of development. There are Crypto Kitties sold for more than 100K USD, so if you have a hand for breeding, what are you waiting for? :)</p>
<p>8.<strong><a href="https://steemhunt.com/@vmirag/cryptofighters-something-better-than-crypto-kitties-cryptofighters">Cryptofighters</a></strong><br>Something better than Crypto Kitties…Cryptofighters!<br>@vmirag·0 votes and 0 comments<br>$0.00<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSQBHKhQoAQxohGiJPX748n4ve5JBbEbZAPWpnA51nbdH/image.png" alt=""><br>The fighters range from 0.005 up to 0.9 Either.  You can collect and battle with other characters to level your fighter up. The design is very simple and there are only a few main character (I counted 4 main characters) with changing colors and attachments  so it did not look really attractive for me. In total there are about 1K fighters at the market place available for sale.</p>

<p>This was the first curation I have done and it takes longer as I thought :). Will see how to manage it to get the same quality faster with tools.</p>
