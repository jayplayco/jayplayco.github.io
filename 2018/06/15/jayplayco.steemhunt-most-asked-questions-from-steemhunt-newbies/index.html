<p>Hi, @jayplayco here. </p>
<p>As a moderator at Steemhunt, I love to share my experience and help people to increase the understanding of the Steemhunt system.</p>
<p>To all readers who are new to <a href="https://steemhunt.com/">Steemhunt</a>, Steemhunt is a recently launched service build on Steem to enable Hunters to hunt new and cool products and get rewarded based on their rankings on a daily base. </p>
<p>This post is to help Steemhunt Newbies to get off the ground and answer the most asked questions they have when entering the Steemhunt community. If you are totally new to Steemhunt, you should try first this post. <a href="https://steemit.com/steemdev/@steemhunt/introducing-steemhunt-daily-ranking-of-effortlessly-cool-products-fueled-by-steem-blockchain">LINK</a></p>
<p>The fresh and all new <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@steemhunt/steemhunt-initiates-account-based-voting-ranking-system">ABV system has now launched at Steemhunt</a> and yesterday was the first day based on this system that gave a new hunter the first rank.</p>
<p>Due to the newly launched ABV, there could be even more questions about how to make a great hunt.</p>
<h3> 0. Repository </h3>
https://github.com/Steemhunt/api


<h4>**1. What kind of Questions are we going to review?**</h4>
 * What is ABV?
 * Which vote counts?
 * What is the best strategy to post a good hunt? 
 * When can I get my upvote?
 * My hunt didn`t get an upvote.
 * I used an upvote bot, do I get blacklisted?
 * I am doing an event to promote my Steemhunt post.
 * What does V2V mean?
 * I have posted my hunt but why is it not reviewed?
* My Hunt has been rejected and I edited it, what should I do now?

<h4>2.Questions and Answer List</h4>
<h5>**a. What is ABV?**</h5>
ABV stands for Account based voting. This means that each account has one voice to vote. As  ABV is now live, you will have to forget about the voting system from Steem, as it does behave totally different. To make it even more fun, the ABV system from Steemhunt has an additional layer of leveling which is realized with the reputation system from Steem.

<p>As result, this means you need to login to Steemhunt and have at least a reputation of (35) at Steem to be able to vote with a power of 0.5. You can have a max vote power of “three” if you have a reputation level of at least (60) at Steem.</p>
<p>Due to this system, your reputation score from Steem is considered in you Steemhunt voting. </p>
<p>The main purpose of this ABV system is to avoid the growth of big whales who can control the whole ranking and give hunters the chance to upvote the product they really like, because that is what Steemhunt is about. Hunt cool and new stuff and upvote for the best one!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeykekaLW1i2vpAqa7a1HaQLduytE7X1FE9v55kFw4pdW/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h5>**b. Which vote counts?**</h5>
So due to ABV,  not all votes are going to be count on Steemhunt. Please look at the list below to see which votes will count.
* Votings made on the Steemhunt page will count. (No Steemit, eSteem, busy, etc)
* Votings on "Today`s" section will count 
* Self Votings are not counted
* Votings on delisted Hunts will not count (after a new announcement it was decided to count them for the raindrop of hunts but still not for the ranking)

<p>This means, if the account is not voting directly at the Steemhunt platform it will have an effect to upvote on Steem but it will not be counted for the Ranking algorithm on Steemhunt. This has a direct effect on upvoting bots, curation trails and also self-voting as these can only higher your Steem vote but will not affect the ranking on Steemhunt at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNsqnmXJwZY3qtKoD8GfChd8D2Z3mr436GbSWgQKJKD6w/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h5>**c. What is the best strategy to post a good hunt?**</h5>
* First of all, read the [posting guideline](https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md) from Steemhunt, as this is going to eliminate most of the problems you could have. You can find the posting guideline always when writing a new hunt on the upper right side.
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcEZDHRR11BjyyBciu5gBDtsuYf5vpfQPDHY68qT2PiC9/image.png)
* Go look for an awesome product or software or innovations. Make sure using the search function and check if the product may have been already hunted. When inputting your Link into the product link, the system will check if the link had been submitted already or not. Using URL shortener to avoid this function will not help, as the moderators will manually recheck and de-list the hunt.
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWa5z5GSDcK8ee5nsPzqwYhMyAK1P2RcQrtvQ6shL7DnW/image.png)
* Describe the product in your own words. Explain why you think this product was hunt worthy and what your thoughts are about the coolness of your hunted product. An appealing format and screenshots or videos are also welcome. Make sure you are using quotation marks if you are quoting some text and always use your own words as the moderators are using plagiarism checker tools from different sources and do an additional manual search to check if your text is unique. 
* Now you are good to go! The hunters in the Steemhunt community are going to upvote your hunt if they like it! :)

<h5>**d. When can I get my upvote?**</h5>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRLMZZEm2VoMt8Ey6W6deVh9HcTtB82dPdRxMtgvoPrff/image.png)

Upvotes from other hunters are depending from every single hunter of course. If your hunt has been verified from a moderator your hunt will be upvoted from the Steemhunt Bot after KST 12:05 (Korean Standard Time). The Steemhunt bot will go through each verified hunt and upvote your hunt according to your rank. This can take up to a few hours, so the best is to have a look into it the next day.

<h5>**e. My hunt didn`t get an upvote.**</h5>
Check if your hunt has been verified and also check the timeline based on KST. When your hunt has been approved and also it is already the next day, but the Steemhunt Bot was not there to upvote your hunt than please follow the steps.
* Go to the Steemhunt Discord Channel [HERE](https://discord.gg/mEwKwG)
* Look for the channel #approved-but-not-upvoted
* Paste your Steemhunt (not steemit or busy) link into that channel.
* The Steemhunt team will review your link and will take care about it.
* If your upvote should have been legit, they put your hunt to the Today`s section again, so it can get upvoted.
* Remind the time difference and that your Hunt has to be reviewed manually, so give the team some time for it.

<h5>**f.  I used an upvote bot, do I get blacklisted?**</h5>
No, don`t worry. You can use an upvote bot, subscription bots, curation tails or self-vote your hunt. But remember that this will have no effect at all for the ranking score at Steemhunt. It will definitely help the Steemhunt community increasing the hunter reward. 

<p>But you <em>will get blacklisted</em> if you do one of the followings</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Asking/accepting vote for vote offer</li>
<li>Buying/selling hunter’s upvotes</li>
<li>Creating/joining a guild for a vote for vote activity</li>
<li>Running a contest or giveaway to get more upvotes on Steemhunt</li>
<li>Running alternative accounts that are used only for his/her own hunting posts</li>
<li>Any other actions that the Steemhunt team deems to be abusive</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h5>**g. I am doing an event to promote my Steemhunt post.**</h5>
This is directly related to point f. above, as it is not allowed to run an event or contest go get more upvotes on Steemhunt. The main reason behind this is that Steemhunt wants the ranking clear of influence based on outside marketing or effects and is trying to empower the hunters to upvote and rank the really cool and great stuff.

<h5>**h. What does V2V mean?**</h5>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZ6BSam5PWjT1bRUfTy6HkdicrXgLZKa3Go5Mf8nVEQSW/image.png)
[Source : rawpixel](https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel)
V2V is a vote for a vote. Scenarios like that are like followed.
* If I vote for you, you vote for me. 
* Let`s make a Discord, twitter, Telegram, etc. channel and gather people to vote for each other
* Writing post or adding text like "please vote for me, I will do the same or will answer your favor, etc."

<p>So all kinds of favoritism for the person despite what kind of product has been hunted can be declined as abusive behavior. So how can the Steemhunt team find out if there is a V2V going on? At the moment the Steemhunt team is depending on the reporting of the community for such abusive behavior. On a later status, there is a so-called Cross-Diversity-Index (CDI) implementation planned, which is looking into the upvoting diversity of the hunters. Additionally, there is a bounty program running for reported hunters abusing the system.</p>
<h5>**i. I have posted my hunt but why is it not reviewed?**</h5>
Steemhunt moderators are located on different continents which are increasing the availability of moderators. Each active moderator is reviewing the uploaded hunts from the oldest to the newest to make sure that no hunt is waiting too long. So it will take some time to get through all hunts, but don`t worry your hunt is going to be reviewed. Asking the moderators when your hunt is going to be reviewed will give you, by the way, the same answer. :)

<p>And don`t worry, if in any case, your hunt was not able to be reviewed the same day, it will be automatically listed in the next days “Today” section.</p>
<h5>**j. My Hunt has been rejected and I edited it, what should I do now?**</h5>
If your Hunt has been rejected and you have been able to edit it according to the posting guideline, you can use the appeal channel at Discord to make your moderator aware of it. 
* Please make sure that the editing has happened at Steemhunt, as otherwise, the edit will not appear at Steemhunt. 
* Go to the Steemhunt Discord [HERE](https://discord.gg/mWXpgks)
* Look which moderator has commented on your hunted post and remember that nickname.
* Look for a channel like #mod-xxx, as an example if I had moderated your post look for the channel #mod-jayplayco
* Post your Steemhunt Link there and add a message what you have done. If needed you can ping the moderator with an @ before the name, like "Hi @jayplayco, I have edited the text"
* A rejected hunt MUST be re-reviewed by the explicit moderator, so due to time differences, this can take much longer than a normal moderation of a new hunt.
