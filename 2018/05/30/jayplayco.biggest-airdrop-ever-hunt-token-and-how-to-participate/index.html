        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Hi, @jayplayco back here with another article about @Steemhunt !</p>
<p>As a Steemian newbie it was really refreshing to see that there is a way to mine coins with writing good content at Steemit.</p>
<p>Especially for Newbies like me I`ve found a good service based on Steemit called @steemhunt and available at <a href="http://steemhunt.com">http://steemhunt.com</a>.</p>
<p>Long story short, <strong>Steemhunt is a steemit based producthunt. </strong><br>Read also : <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@jayplayco/what-is-steemhunt-and-why-should-i-care">Article about what Steemhunt is!</a></p>
<p>This time we are going to learn about the airdrop Steemhunt is currently planning, as this will be one of the biggest airdrops available at Steemit.</p>
<p><strong><h3>1. What is a Hunt Token?</h3></strong><br>Hunt Token is going to be a Smart Media Token (<a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@ned/announcing-smart-media-tokens-smts">SMT</a>) based Token, which means that it will be build based on the <a href="https://smt.steem.io/">Whitepaper</a> from Ned back in Sep 2017. It is going to be a decentralised token system to reward product influencers, buy kickstarted products and help makers and brands to reach out product influencers on the Steemhunt.com platform.</p>
<p>At Steemhunt the HUNT Tokens can be earned being actively writing product reviews and on the other side there is are separate categories where makers can earn HUNT Tokens kickstarting projects (Ideahunt) and also can spend HUNT Tokens to recruite product reviewer (Reviewhunt)</p>
<p>Steemhunt is going to issue 500M HUNT Tokens and 50% of them are going to be airdropped. Yes, you read it right, 50%, in total 250M HUNT Tokens are going to be distributed.</p>
<p><strong><h3>2. What does the HUNT Token distribution looks like?</h3></strong><br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbX1bEMiEr5nXnQ9cdVfajGR8k9zy3YExeUBxSLMV1Pcf/image.png" alt=""><br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmW7izfiQDcikYsaRuRrrRBPke77EPWcQudVwpt4JWzsSx/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong><h3>3. Give me HUNT Tokens! But how?</h3></strong></p>
<p>There are in total 5 different ways to gain HUNT Tokens from the Airdrop for FREE! (20% of the volume are going to be into the private sale sector, so will not count them here!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Get it if you <strong>have Steem Power</strong> (beg. July 2018)</li>
<li>Get it if you <strong>delegate Steem Power</strong> (available NOW)</li>
<li>Get it if you <strong>collect Referrals</strong> (end July 2018)</li>
<li>Get it if you <strong>Vote and resteem articles</strong> (beg. June 2018)</li>
<li>Get if if you <strong>Hunt products and review them</strong> (end July 2018)</li>
</ul>
<p>So let`s get into it step by step. Be informed that most of the Airdrop schedules are still not prepared and we are going to wait for announcements from Steemhunt.</p>
<h3>**a.Have Steem Power**</h3>
Easy one. Just have a look if you have any Steem Power. (If not, you can buy some or just start writing good content or even better start steemhunting!) You can find it under https://steemit.com/@YOURNAMEHERE/transfers. If you have delegated some of your Steem Power, don`t worry. Steemhunt will count the original available Steempower.
After that join Steemhunt.com at wait for their announcement. (Following @steemhunt will make it easier) Steemhunt is going to add a menu where you can APPLY for HUNT Tokens. It is very important that you ACTIVELY APPLY for HUNT Tokens at Steemhunt, so the best is to go to Steemhunt.com and just join the service for now. You need to have an active Steemit account. HUNT Tokens are going to be airdropped 1:1 to your Steem Power, based on "First Come First Serve", but Steemhunt has prepared about 100M, so there is a plenty of HUNT Tokens for almost everybody.

<p><strong>How much do I get?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>exactly the same amount of your Steem Power you own is going to be airdropped.</li>
</ul>
<h3>**b.Delegate Steem Power**</h3>
This is the only Airdrop you can already join right now.  For that you have to delegate your Steem Power to @steemhunt. 

<p><a href="https://steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&delegatee=steemhunt&vesting_shares=100%20SP">100 SP</a> | <a href="https://steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&delegatee=steemhunt&vesting_shares=500%20SP">500 SP</a> | <a href="https://steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&delegatee=steemhunt&vesting_shares=1000%20SP">1000 SP</a> </p>
<p>Or just manually change the URL inputting the wanted amount below. Change the “vesting_shares=1000” to “vesting_shares=WANTEDAMOUNT”.<br><a href="https://steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&amp;delegatee=steemhunt&amp;vesting_shares=1000%20SP">https://steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&amp;delegatee=steemhunt&amp;vesting_shares=1000%20SP</a></p>
<p><strong>How much do I get?</strong><br>This is difficult to say. Steemhunt has reserved a daily amount of 90K for all delegated Steem Power (They have actually have over 330K Steempower in this moment) You will get a daily amount of HUNT Tokens based on your Ratio you have delegated. On the last report this was about 190 HUNT Tokens for 100SP delegated. My guess is this will drop quite fast, as more people will join the Steemhunt community and are going to delegate SP to them. But the sooner the better, as the drops are planned for about 500 days, until the SMT will be ready. (Don`t think it will take that long, as Ned has announced it already for 2018)</p>
<h3>**c.Collect Referrals**</h3>
An often seen marketing method to engage users and give them benefits. The referral system is still under development. In total 90K Tokens are reserved per day and will be distributed to people who refer Steemhunt to others. So sign up for steemhunt.com, wait until the development for the referral system is done and get your referral link and spread the goods news! Max cap is 5000 per Person. 

<p><strong>How much do I get?</strong><br>Important here is to be fast, as the days past on more and more people will have referrals and the total assigned tokens of 90K pcs. will shrink per day. Calculation is based on 90,000 Tokens assigned by 1/n (referrals)<br>If there are 90,000 referrals collected, you will get 1 HUNT Token per day.</p>
<h3>**d.Vote and resteem**</h3>
In total 60K Tokens per day will be distributed for Steemhunters who are upvoting or resteeming hunters posts located under the **"TODAY"** tap. Important is, only the TODAY Tab will be counted. 40K are for upvoters and 20K for resteemers. Airdrop starts when the wallet interface is ready.

<p><strong>How much do I get?</strong><br>If at that day 2000 people are resteeming hunters post, you will get 10 HUNT tokens. If 2000 people are upvoting hunters posts from the Today tab, you will get 20 HUNT tokens and so on. Important is also that these activities have to be done AT steemhunt.com and not steemit.com.</p>
<h3>**e.Hunt products and review them**</h3>

<p>If you have been succesfully upvoted from @steemhunt you will be 60,000TOKENS/n of the daily airdrop. In total steemhunt upvotes the post itself, a review comment (pros and cons comments) and moderator comments. Additionally the voting power from steemhunt is also important how much of the distributed Tokens you will get.</p>
<p><strong>How much do I get?</strong><br>This is going to be really difficult to give an exact amount, as it depends on the voting power of steemhunt (which also depends on how your post is ranked, etc.). At the current moment the daily total VP pool is about 1080%, so if you get a voting with 20% this will be about 880 HUNT TOKENS. So this means writing good steemhunter contents is essential!</p>
<p><strong><h3>4. Conclusion</h3></strong></p>
<p>HUNT Tokens are going to create an own economy based on the Steemit.com community. All kind of rewards are going to be paid later on as HUNT Tokens and seeing producthunt.com growing even under that kind of circumstances (not reawarding the actual hunters), I strongly believe that Steemhunt can replace this, as soon as enough people are getting used to this kind of system. As there is no max supply for HUNT, there WILL be an inflation which has been vital as example also for the Steem community.</p>
<p>Be informed that the SMT from steemit is also still under development and that therefore the steemhunt team has decided to start as Ethereum ERC20 Token and then swap them afterwords when the SMT network is ready.</p>
