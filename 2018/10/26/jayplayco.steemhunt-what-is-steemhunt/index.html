<p>Hi, @jayplayco here.<br>This time I would like to introduce Steemhunt for people coming outside of Steem. It would be great to resteem it not only internally of Steem but also outside on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and co. :)</p>
<h2> 0. Repository </h2>
https://github.com/Steemhunt/web

<h2>1. What is Steemhunt?</h2>
<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdmrqQpZKvSTnjwYxz9GcE9MCUpcQckW9hE1ooKEYwKVQ/image.png)</center>

<p>URL: <a href="https://steemhunt.com/">https://steemhunt.com/</a></p>
<p>Steemhunt is a community-based platform for product influencers. Users here are called hunters. As a hunter, you can hunt cool and new products which compete on a ranking board on a daily basis. Other hunters can upvote the hunts when they like them. Each hunted product has the chance to climb to the top of the daily ranking. The best part is that the upvotes from other hunters are worth something, as you can gain a currency called STEEM(or SBD) with each upvote. If you want, you can change STEEM(or SBD) to Bitcoin (or similar) and then to USD on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/#markets">different exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>If you love gadgets or looking for inspirations, this is the right place to be.</p>
<h2>2. I am in, how should I start?</h2>
<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQtBgZVBygHjVRxezEvarPzc3rES8MG9AY7o1MgkGXaW2/image.png)</center>

<p>First of all, you will need to signup on Steemhunt. </p>
<ul>
<li>You are creating a so-called STEEM account. Think of it as a Google OAuth like login for multiple services. Compared to Google, you can use on some web pages your Google account to log in. With this STEEM account, you can log in to other STEEM services.</li>
<li>Look for the Signup button and click on it.</li>
<li>Choose a username</li>
<li>Enter your mobile phone number and an SMS will be sent to you</li>
<li>Enter the confirmation code received on your mobile phone</li>
<li>Confirm it and you will get to a confirmation screen with your password.</li>
<li><div class="phishy"> STOP</div> Copy your password, as you will never see it again!!!</li>
<li>It is still essential to copy your password and keep it safe.</li>
<li>Steemhunt is not able to retrieve your password. If you have copied your password, you can click on continue.</li>
<li>You are now able to log in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. I have logged in and now?</h2>
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeNmqq5SquciLWVpjJWYcU3Q7YMmPbbSHdF1kQhPrZKnU/image.png)

<p>There are several activities you can do. Go for hunting a new product or look for inspirations and upvote products you like. Or move over to <a href="https://discord.gg/mWXpgks">Discord where other hunters are chatting</a> with each other.</p>
<h3>a. Hunting a product</h3>

<p>Hunting a product is not difficult. Look for cool products and post them according to the <a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md">posting guideline.</a> A Steemhunt moderator will review your hunt manually, which can take up to 48h and leave a comment if the hunt is verified or not. If not reviewed on the same day it will move to the next day ranking board.</p>
<p>Hunters can upvote your hunt on Steemhunt when not delisted from a moderator. Each upvote does not count with the same weight. There is a <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@jayplayco/steemhunt-understanding-the-hunter-levels">hunter level</a> in place which decides how strong a vote is. If you can get votes from seasoned hunters with higher levels, your hunt will have a better chance to rank higher. </p>
<p>Some points you should care about before you start.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don`t look for products that have been hunted. (Use the search function to avoid duplicates)</li>
<li>Steemhunt only allows specific categories of products. You can check them <a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md">here.</a></li>
<li>Don`t copy and paste text from other places.</li>
<li>It is recommended to read the <a href="https://github.com/Steemhunt/web/blob/master/POSTING_GUIDELINES.md">Posting Guideline</a> to understand what is allowed and what is not.</li>
</ul>
<h3>b. Upvoting other hunts</h3>
If you are not directly looking into hunting products, you can also help other hunters and upvote cool products. Just look for the "Today" section and press the arrow up button for a hunt.

<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmebQZoMupPWt4279yBuSoPJhEKVss5ogLSjMSFNxLSKDb/image.png)</center>

<p>You should not upvote more than ten hunts per day in the first moment. (There is a technical background, but on we will talk about it on a later article)</p>
<p>You can also comment on a hunt you like, but also don`t comment on more than one hunt per day in the beginning. (Yes, also a technical background here) </p>
<h3>c. Chatting with other hunters on </h3>
Intermediate communication between hunters is happening only partly on the Steemhunt platform.  A lot of hunters using a group chat service called Discord. You can join the group chat for Steemhunt [here for free.](https://discord.gg/mWXpgks) 

<p>Use the same username you have used for Steemhunt and look for the channels “#questions” if you need to ask something or “#discussions” if you have ideas about Steemhunt or want to read more about what other hunters are thinking about Steemhunt. “#faq” is an excellent channel to give you answers for most frequent questions.</p>
<h2>4. I like it, but is there more?</h2>
Yes, and congratulation. You are now using a D'app on the Steem Blockchain. And you are mining your first cryptocurrencies with upvoting and hunting products. Understanding the technical background and meaning of the Steem Blockchain is at least a few articles for itself. But for now, have fun using Steemhunt and looking for great products. If you get used to Steemhunt and have more questions, you will find a good list of articles below to start to read. 

<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
